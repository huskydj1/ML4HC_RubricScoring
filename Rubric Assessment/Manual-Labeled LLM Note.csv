[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000," So, I'd just like to talk to you about our considerations and our plans for your c-section.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:41.000 --> 07:42.000, That's okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000, Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.000," So, as you probably know from your prior c-sections, we often do the surgeries that",,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000, are under spinal or epidural anesthesia.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:55.000 --> 08:01.000," So, one of patients had multiple prior c-section or for concern that there might be a high risk",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000, of bleeding and the surgery might take a little longer than normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000, We usually opt for something longer acting.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:07.000 --> 08:14.000, That usually means either a spinal injection with a longer acting anesthetic or what's called a,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000, combined spinal epidural.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000, This basically means that just like before we'll give you an injection into this spinal,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000, space that we'll make you numb for the surgery from the mid chest and below.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:24.000 --> 08:30.000, But we might also place an epidural catheter during that procedure so that we can extend the duration,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000, of your anesthesia if we need to.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.000, Does that make sense so far?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.000, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.000, Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000," Now, the final decision about the anesthesia will depend on the discussion between the",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000, anesthesia team that day and your obstetrician.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:44.000 --> 08:45.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000, Those are both very safe procedures.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000, Let's talk to you more about the risks of the benefits of spinal and epidurals on the,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.000, day of.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:53.000 --> 08:54.000, Is that okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000, Am I going to have something for pain control?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000, You will have something for pain control.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000, We will give you medications into this final that will both keep you numb for the surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000, itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000, It will also be one of the medications that will be on board in your system for the first 24,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000, hours after the surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000, That will help give you some element of baseline pain coverage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000," We'll also give you scheduled medications like Tylenol and low trim, which will help with pain control.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000," If you need something beyond that, we can always order as needed in our chronic medications.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000, Very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:37.000 --> 09:46.000," Now, because you have a higher than normal risk of bleeding, we might do a couple extra things.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000," We want to make sure that your IV access is good, so that if needed, we can give you IV fluids.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:52.000 --> 09:59.000," If you have an elevated risk, if you lose more blood loss than we would prefer, that we're able to give you blood transfusions",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.000, quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000, So we might place another IV.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000, We might use an ultrasound to do that if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000, Does that sound okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000," If you need a blood transfusion, only if you need to, are you okay receiving a blood transfusion during your",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:14.000 --> 10:15.000, C-section?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000," Yeah, I want everything to make sure that I'm doing okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000, Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:21.000 --> 10:27.000," Now, we might also place a special model called an arterial line.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000," If needed, if we have any issues, monitoring your blood pressure during the surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000, We typically place this into one of the arteries that's in your wrist.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000," From your perspective, it's very similar to an IV, but it monitors the blood pressure on a beef to beef basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:44.000 --> 10:51.000, If we're having trouble monitoring your blood pressure with the regular cuff on your arm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000," For that, we may also use an ultrasound and make if something medication, how to make it more comfortable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000," Now, we'll be communicating closely with your OB team about blood loss during the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000," If you have significant blood loss, we might give you a variety of medications to help your uterus contract",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000, or to help the breakdown of clotting factors in your blood.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000, We're careful to only give these everything that you need them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000," Now, most of those medications are completely acceptable for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:24.000 --> 11:31.000," There's one that's called methodogen, which we typically try to avoid in patients with higher blood pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.000, But all of the others should be safe to use for you based on your medical history.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:39.000 --> 11:48.000," Now, if your bleeding is very significant, or if your OB decides that there's a situation in which your uterus needs to be removed, in case of various areas of bleeding,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000, we may adjust our anesthetic plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000," Typically, in those situations, we proceed to what's called general anesthesia.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000, That's where you go completely to sleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000, We give medications to the IV that we'll make you go to sleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000," Then we'll place everything to, at that point, to keep your airway nice and safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000," We'll only do that if we need to, and we'll be sure to communicate with you before that happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000, I hope this really doesn't happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000, We're very scary.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000, Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000," We hope not as well, and all likelihood that we'll probably not happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000, These are all the situations we just want to make you aware of ahead of time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:27.000 --> 12:35.000," Just in case that they do happen, we're able to, a big surprise to you, and we're able to proceed as quickly as we can.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000, Does that make sense?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000, Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.000, Very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:38.000 --> 12:45.000," Now, if you do need the general anesthesia with the breathing tube, our goal is always for it to be a temporary measure during the surgery itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000," Our hope is that once the surgery is done, we can turn off the anesthesia and make you up and take out that breathing tube.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000," But sometimes, in rare cases,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.000," if we need to further stabilize you with more medication or more blood products, you may go to a more monitored unit, such as an intensive care unit.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000," In that scenario, we would leave everything to you and make sure you're getting sedating medication to keep you asleep while breathing tube is in.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000," Only once everything is nice and stabilized, well, they turn off the anesthesia and take out the breathing tube.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000, I don't anticipate that for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:22.000 --> 13:33.000, It's a possibility we want you to know that we are keeping these things in mind and we'll do everything we can to make sure that you're safe all throughout this procedure and afterward.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000, That was a lot of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000, What questions do you have about any of that?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000," Yeah, I just need to leave them more time to think about it, but right now I don't have any questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000," We will discuss all of these things that day of the surgery is well, and talk to you in more depth about any questions that you have.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000, So you have time to think about them.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:55.000 --> 14:05.000," In the meantime, before we let you go, we'll have you speak with Dr. Jones, who's one of the attending anesthesiologists here at the Bergam and Moons Hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000, Is that okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000," Hi, Ms. Blink. This is Dr. Jones. I'm one of the obstetric anesthesiologists here at Bergam and Moons.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000, Hi.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000, Hi there. It's very nice to meet you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000, I read your chart and I'm listening along to your conversation with Dr. Smith.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000, It sounds like he mentioned some of our considerations for patients who are a higher risk of bleeding.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000, Just wanted to make sure that you don't have any more questions at this time before we hang up with him.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000," No, I'm good.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.000, Okay. Very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000, We will document everything we discuss on this phone call in a note in your chart.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000, That way the team taking care of you the day of surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000," No, is everything that we've talked about.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000," Otherwise, that should be it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000, I'll be sure to keep you safe and comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000, Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000, Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.000, Have a nice day.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000, Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
