High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRN: 000000018,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 34,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G3P0020,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 33w3d,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiple Gestation: No – singleton pregnancy,,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,Positive,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
"Placenta previa in setting of prior uterine surgery (myomectomy, dilation & evacuation) and uterine fibroids; evaluation for elevated risk of postpartum hemorrhage.",Positive,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,Positive,Negative,,,,Positive,Negative,,,,,
"Ms. Jane Blank is a 34-year-old G3P0020 at 33w3d with a singleton pregnancy complicated by placenta previa identified on recent ultrasound. She has a known history of uterine fibroids, including one located in the lower uterine segment, and has previously undergone a hysteroscopic myomectomy and two dilation and evacuations for pregnancy loss. Her pregnancy was achieved via IVF. She denies any vaginal bleeding, hypertensive disorders, or preeclampsia. Her most recent laboratory values are reassuring with a hemoglobin of 14 g/dL and hematocrit of 44%, though she reports mild dehydration. No signs of placenta accreta or abnormal amniotic fluid levels are noted on imaging.",Positive,Negative,,,,Positive,Negative,,,Positive,,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms. Blank has no prior deliveries. She has had two D&Es for early pregnancy losses and underwent one hysteroscopic myomectomy for fibroid removal. She has no history of postpartum hemorrhage, uterine rupture, or abnormal placentation. This is her first cesarean delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Past medical history is notable for asthma managed with daily Symbicort and intermittent albuterol use; she has never required hospitalization for asthma. No other cardiopulmonary disease, coagulopathy, or transfusion history is reported. She takes levothyroxine and prenatal vitamins, and has no drug allergies. She denies any personal or family history of anesthetic complications, scoliosis, or spinal/back surgery. She is otherwise healthy and has tolerated this pregnancy well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Physical Exam: Deferred – phone consultation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 34-year-old G3P0020 at 33w3d with placenta previa, prior uterine instrumentation (D&Es and myomectomy), and lower uterine fibroids. She is at elevated risk for postpartum hemorrhage due to these cumulative factors. While imaging shows no signs of accreta, uterine fibroids and prior surgeries may increase intraoperative complexity and bleeding risk.",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scheduled cesarean delivery due to placenta previa and obstructing fibroid.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Planned neuraxial anesthesia – likely a longer-acting spinal or combined spinal-epidural, given the potential for prolonged surgical time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"General anesthesia reserved as backup for inadequate neuraxial block or emergent need (e.g., hemorrhage, hysterectomy).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Neuraxial block appropriate; no contraindications.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient educated on possibility of conversion to general anesthesia.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Continue usual asthma medications on day of surgery; preoperative albuterol may be administered if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring / Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two large-bore peripheral IVs to be placed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ultrasound guidance may be used if access is difficult.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consider arterial line placement intraoperatively if hemodynamic instability or major hemorrhage occurs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Standard uterotonics (oxytocin, misoprostol, methylergonovine) available.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Avoid carboprost due to asthma history.,,,,,,,,,,,,
TXA (tranexamic acid) can be used if indicated.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Standard postpartum monitoring unless intraoperative bleeding necessitates escalation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
ICU admission may be considered for hemodynamic instability or prolonged intubation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If general anesthesia is required intraoperatively, patient may remain sedated and intubated postoperatively until stable for extubation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient was agreeable to blood transfusion if needed and expressed understanding of anesthesia risks and plans. All questions were answered.,,,,,,,,,,,,
