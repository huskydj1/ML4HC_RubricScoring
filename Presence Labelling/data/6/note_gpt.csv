[High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient Name: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRN: 000000005,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 38,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G5P3013,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 33w0d,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiple Gestation: No (Singleton pregnancy),,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placenta previa in the setting of prior postpartum hemorrhage and current use of therapeutic anticoagulation (Lovenox) during pregnancy.,Positive,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
History of Present Illness,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ms. Jane Blank is a 38-year-old G5P3013 at 33w0d with a singleton gestation who was referred for high-risk obstetric anesthesia consultation due to placenta previa and a history of postpartum hemorrhage following her last vaginal delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Imaging shows placenta previa without sonographic signs of placenta accreta.,Positive,Negative,,Negative,,Negative,,,,,,
The fetus is appropriately grown and amniotic fluid volume is within normal limits.,,,,Negative,Negative,,,,,,,
She is on prophylactic Lovenox due to a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 10 years ago while on oral contraceptives.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Her OB team plans to switch her from Lovenox to heparin after 36 weeks to better facilitate anesthetic planning. Her labs are within expected range for pregnancy: hemoglobin 10 g/dL, hematocrit 30%, platelets 180K. She has not had any bleeding episodes in this pregnancy.",,,,,,,,,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms. Blank has had three prior vaginal deliveries, all with epidural analgesia without complication.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Her most recent delivery was complicated by delayed postpartum hemorrhage due to retained placental tissue, resulting in an estimated blood loss of approximately 1.2 liters and requiring a dilation and curettage (D&C).",,,,,,,,,,,,
She had one additional prior D&C procedure.,,,,,,,,,,,,
She has not had any cesarean deliveries.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No history of uterine rupture, placenta accreta, or uterine inversion.",,Negative,,,,Negative,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her medical history includes a prior DVT (provoked by OCP use) for which she is currently on Lovenox during pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
"She is otherwise healthy with no known cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, or endocrine disease.",,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
"No history of hypertension, asthma, or bleeding/clotting disorders apart from the prior DVT.",,,,,,,Negative,Negative,,,,
She had an appendectomy many years ago but no other abdominal or pelvic surgeries.,,,,,,,,,,,,
She reports good functional status and activity tolerance during this pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
She denies scoliosis or any spine-related procedures.,,,,,,,,,,,,
No personal or family history of anesthetic complications.,,,,,,,,Negative,,,,
No known drug allergies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Physical Exam: Deferred (telehealth consult),,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 38-year-old G5P3013 at 33w0d with a singleton pregnancy complicated by placenta previa, history of delayed postpartum hemorrhage with prior vaginal delivery, and current therapeutic anticoagulation with Lovenox for a remote history of DVT.",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
These factors place her at increased risk for significant postpartum hemorrhage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
She may require cesarean delivery depending on resolution of previa and has elevated anesthetic risk due to recent anticoagulant use and prior hemorrhagic complications.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Planned cesarean delivery unless previa resolves sufficiently for vaginal delivery.,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Switch from Lovenox to heparin around 36 weeks as coordinated with OB team.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Preferred: Neuraxial anesthesia (spinal or combined spinal-epidural) if anticoagulation appropriately held.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Backup: General anesthesia if neuraxial is contraindicated or if conversion is needed intraoperatively due to bleeding or duration.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	For labor, epidural catheter placement is acceptable if vaginal delivery becomes feasible and Lovenox has been discontinued for appropriate interval.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	For cesarean, planned neuraxial (likely spinal); combined spinal-epidural may be considered if prolonged surgical time is anticipated.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	General anesthesia reserved for intraoperative instability, significant hemorrhage, or if neuraxial is contraindicated due to anticoagulation.",,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
Monitoring/Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Two large-bore IVs to be placed preoperatively.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Consider arterial line placement if significant bleeding occurs or for close hemodynamic monitoring.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Ultrasound-guided vascular access and local anesthetic to be used as needed for line placement.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Standard uterotonics (oxytocin, methylergonovine, carboprost, misoprostol) available as indicated.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Tranexamic acid to be avoided due to prior history of thromboembolism.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Post-anesthesia recovery with close hemodynamic monitoring.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Possible ICU admission if unstable or requiring continued transfusion/blood product support.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	If general anesthesia and intubation required, patient may remain sedated and ventilated postoperatively until clinically stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion: All anticipated risks and plans were reviewed in detail with the patient via phone. She voiced understanding and had no further questions at this time. She is aware that final anesthetic decisions will be based on her clinical status on the day of delivery and coordination with the obstetric team.,,,,,,,,,,,,
