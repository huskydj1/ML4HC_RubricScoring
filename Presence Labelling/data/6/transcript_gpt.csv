"[00:15.960 --> 00:21.080]: asked our team to reach out with you to chat about some anesthesia-related considerations,",,,,,,,,,,,,

"[00:26.840 --> 00:32.880]: We've reviewed your chart. We'd just like to review your history, discuss some of the findings",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:32.880 --> 00:41.420]: from the current pregnancy, and talk a little more about your obstetric history. Okay. Great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:41.420 --> 00:47.840]: So, looking at the ultrasound, it looks like you have some placenta previa, is that correct? Yes.",Positive,Negative,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:47.840 --> 00:53.460]: Very good. Based on that ultrasound, it doesn't show any other abnormalities with the placenta,",,Negative,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:53.460 --> 00:56.340]: like placenta accreta. Is that correct, as far as you're aware?",,Negative,,,,,,,,,,
[00:56.340 --> 00:56.840]: Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:56.840 --> 01:05.600]: I was not told anything more than that. Perfect. Otherwise, it looks like the fluid around the baby",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[01:05.600 --> 01:11.180]: is normal. The baby is normal size. I mean, you don't have any history of fibroids. Does all of",,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
"[01:11.180 --> 01:16.580]: that seem correct? Yeah. Very good. Otherwise, in this pregnancy, do you have any history of",,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:16.580 --> 01:26.480]: anything like preeclampsia? No. Very good. Are you taking any blood thinners at all? Yes. I,,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
[01:26.840 --> 01:37.460]: do. I started taking Lovenox during the pregnancy because I previously had a clot.,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,

[01:47.500 --> 01:56.680]: Okay. I see. You were only in Lovenox during the pregnancy? Yes. Okay. Very good. Has your OB team,,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:56.840 --> 02:00.220]: talk to you about the plan for the Lovinox as you get closer to delivering?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:00.740 --> 02:05.640]: They mentioned that they would switch me to another medication.,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
"[02:06.020 --> 02:12.760]: I forgot what it was, but that would be later after 36 weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:13.600 --> 02:14.200]: Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:14.380 --> 02:14.800]: Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:15.020 --> 02:17.760]: Often they transition to a medication called heparin.,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
[02:17.900 --> 02:18.260]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:18.440 --> 02:18.880]: At the end.,,,,,,,,,,,,

[02:20.980 --> 02:21.380]: Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:21.380 --> 02:27.820]: Um, we'll check your obstetrician notes and, um, coordinate with them, but typically we",,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:27.820 --> 02:32.720]: change to heparin and then give instructions on when to stop prior to you coming in.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:32.860 --> 02:33.380]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:33.920 --> 02:34.380]: Great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:35.380 --> 02:41.140]: Um, otherwise, just based on looking at your labs, your hemoglobin is 10 and your hematocrit",,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
[02:41.140 --> 02:43.580]: is 30 and your platelet count is 180.,,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
"[02:43.740 --> 02:47.160]: So those are all within expected limits, um, during pregnancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:48.160 --> 02:51.360]: Um, I'm going to ask you a little bit more about your prior obstetrics.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:51.380 --> 02:52.580]: History, if that's okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:52.840 --> 02:53.080]: Yep.,,,,,,,,,,,,

[03:12.600 --> 03:13.060]: Fantastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,

[03:43.420 --> 03:44.240]: It was a little bit delayed.,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[05:59.980 --> 06:00.980]: Any procedures or any hardware in your back, as far as you're aware?",,,,,,,,,,,,

[06:01.980 --> 06:02.980]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:02.980 --> 06:03.980]: Very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:03.980 --> 06:04.980]: So, um, for this placenta previa, I understand the plan will be for a cesarean section, as",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:04.980 --> 06:05.980]: a standard.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:05.980 --> 06:06.980]: Um, and I understand this is your first time having a C-section, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:06.980 --> 06:07.980]: Well, the doctor said that if, um, it's a C-section, it's a C-section, it's a C-section,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:07.980 --> 06:08.980]: it's a C-section, it's a C-section, it's a C-section, it's a C-section, it's a C-section,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:08.980 --> 06:09.980]: it's a C-section, it's a C-section, it's a C-section.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:09.980 --> 06:11.120]: Well, the doctor said that if, um, it may, uh, improve, and if that's the case, I can",,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:11.120 --> 06:12.120]: have vaginal delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:12.120 --> 06:13.120]: But, otherwise, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:13.120 --> 06:14.120]: Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:14.120 --> 06:15.140]: Um, we just want to talk to you a little bit more about our considerations, uh, for",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:15.140 --> 06:16.140]: patients who have placenta previa and some other comorbidities, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:16.140 --> 06:17.140]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:17.140 --> 06:18.140]: So, given that you're having a C-section, what positive changes or negative changes",,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:18.140 --> 06:19.140]: are you seeing?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:19.140 --> 06:20.140]: So, I understand that you're having a C-section, and what positive changes do you feel",,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:20.140 --> 06:21.140]: you're seeing?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:21.140 --> 06:22.140]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:22.140 --> 06:23.140]: So, for this placenta previa, I understand the plan will be for a cesarean section,",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:23.140 --> 06:24.140]: as a standard.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:24.140 --> 06:31.780]: have a vaginal delivery but otherwise yes got it um we just want to talk to you a little bit more,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:31.780 --> 06:37.860]: about our considerations uh for patients who have placenta previa and some other comorbidities okay,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:37.860 --> 06:43.520]: so given the previa itself as well as some of your history including your history of a bleed in the,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:43.520 --> 06:49.900]: past um you're at higher risk than most for bleeding surrounding the time of delivery,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:49.900 --> 07:00.840]: um so we just want to talk about our plan on our end um so for patients um when we do c-sections,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:00.840 --> 07:05.800]: uh generally we do these under what's called neuraxial anesthesia either a spinal or epidural,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:05.800 --> 07:12.120]: i know you're familiar with the epidural which helps keep you comfortable and um,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:12.120 --> 07:19.060]: using a little epidural catheter and if everything improves and you have another vaginal delivery,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:19.060 --> 07:19.860]: certainly,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:19.900 --> 07:25.820]: could do another epidural for you if we do a cesarean section we typically do it under what's,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:25.820 --> 07:31.560]: called a spinal anesthetic which is very similar to an epidural but rather than being a small,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:31.560 --> 07:36.360]: catheter it's a single shot injection into the spinal space that gets you numb for the surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:36.360 --> 07:44.020]: okay they're very similar um in terms of how they're placed um but those are basically the,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:44.020 --> 07:47.960]: two options we can also do what's called a combined spinal epidural where you get the,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:47.960 --> 07:49.880]: injection as well as a catheter that goes through the epidural and then you can do a,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:49.900 --> 07:54.140]: spoke to do that and then a secondary section goes into the epidural space,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:54.140 --> 07:57.060]: depending on the plan we will do one of those but most likely it'll be a spinal for a cesarean,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:57.060 --> 08:06.180]: section okay okay um now there are some other considerations we have for patients at higher,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:06.180 --> 08:15.880]: risk of bleeding we want to have good iv access as you know we have iv an iv place during the labor,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:15.880 --> 08:19.740]: process and to help give you fluids and other medications if you're at a higher risk of bleeding,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:19.740 --> 08:23.800]: we often replace a second IV to make sure we have good access ahead of time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:23.800 --> 08:30.540]: Okay. Okay. We may use an ultrasound to help locate some bigger veins. We might,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:30.540 --> 08:35.100]: use some numbing medication to help make the procedure less uncomfortable. Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:35.100 --> 08:43.420]: Okay. Now if you do have some higher than normal bleeding during the delivery or,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:43.420 --> 08:47.340]: during the cesarean section, there's medications that we can give that can",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:47.340 --> 08:52.260]: help stop the bleeding by helping your uterus to contract or to help prevent,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:52.260 --> 08:58.560]: the breakdown of clots in your blood. So most of those are acceptable for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:58.560 --> 09:02.820]: Given your clotting history, we would probably avoid one of them called",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:02.820 --> 09:10.060]: tranexamic acid, which can basically help with extra clotting. Okay. Okay. But",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:10.060 --> 09:16.020]: the other medications we can give you to help prevent or improve the bleeding,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:16.020 --> 09:17.320]: that's happening. Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:17.320 --> 09:24.720]: Okay. Now and sometimes in these events we need to give blood transfusions. Are,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:24.720 --> 09:29.200]: you okay receiving blood only if necessary? Yeah, my doctor mentioned that",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:29.200 --> 09:37.420]: this can happen. Okay. Fantastic. Some other interventions we include include,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:37.420 --> 09:42.620]: what's called an arterial line, which is a special IV that goes into the artery",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:42.620 --> 09:46.420]: rather than the vein to monitor the blood pressure. We only do that if we're,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:46.420 --> 09:47.300]: in a situation where we're in a situation where we're in a situation where we're,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:47.300 --> 09:53.060]: having kind of continued bleeding and we need closer monitoring of your blood,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:53.060 --> 10:01.280]: pressure rather than cycling a cuff. Okay. So we may consider that at some point in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:01.280 --> 10:07.940]: the process. Now if things progress further, we may need to convert to what's",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:07.940 --> 10:12.360]: called general anesthesia, which is where you're completely asleep. We place a",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:12.360 --> 10:17.180]: breathing tube while you're asleep to help with your breathing. It's similar to what you had for the appendectomy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:17.300 --> 10:22.540]: We only do that if we get into a situation where intimate bleeding continues and we,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:22.540 --> 10:26.920]: need a little bit more control, or if you're having some discomfort. Okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.920 --> 10:33.060]: than ultimately if we do that the goal is always to have your sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:33.060 --> 10:38.960]: only for during the procedure itself. Now if you are still are needing a little,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:38.960 --> 10:42.420]: bit more fluids, or more blood products to be given,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:42.420 --> 10:46.860]: and you're not quite stable enough to wake up, we'll keep you asleep and sedated with asescent, andство sedated with the sedation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:47.300 --> 10:53.780]: breathing tube in and take you to a monitored unit such as an ICU until you're more stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:53.780 --> 10:57.780]: At that point of the men they would wake you up and we would take out the breathing tube.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:57.780 --> 11:02.820]: Okay. That's a very very rare scenario. I don't anticipate that for you but we want to give you,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:02.820 --> 11:07.140]: a good idea of all the things that we are considering and preparing for just in case,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:07.140 --> 11:12.660]: you have an abnormal amount of bleeding. Okay. Okay. That was a lot of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:12.660 --> 11:18.420]: What questions do you have for me? I don't have any questions at this time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:18.420 --> 11:23.380]: Okay. Very good. Before we let you go, we're going to briefly have you speak with Dr. Jones,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:23.380 --> 11:26.900]: one of the attending anesthesiologists here at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:26.900 --> 11:32.820]: Okay. Hi, Ms. Blank. This is Dr. Jones. I'm one of the obstetric anesthesiologists here at",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:32.820 --> 11:37.780]: Brigham and Women's. I read your chart and I was listening along with the conversation with Dr.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:37.780 --> 11:42.420]: Smith. It sounds like he mentioned some of our considerations for patients who have a higher,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:42.420 --> 11:42.500]: risk of breast cancer than those who have a higher risk of breast cancer than those who have a higher,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:42.500 --> 11:42.660]: risk of breast cancer than those who have a higher risk of breast cancer than those who have a higher risk,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:42.660 --> 11:44.500]: of breast cancer than those who have a higher risk of bleeding. I just want to make sure you,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:44.500 --> 11:49.300]: don't have any more questions about anything before we hang up. No, I'm all set for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:50.020 --> 11:54.660]: Okay. Very good. We'll document everything we discussed on this phone call in a note in your,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:54.660 --> 12:01.700]: chart so that the team taking care of you knows what we talked about. That should be it. Otherwise,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:01.700 --> 12:12.500]: we'll be sure to keep you safe and comfortable. Thank you. Bye-bye. Have a nice day. Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
