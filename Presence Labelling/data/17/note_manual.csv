High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient Name: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gestational Age: 33w3d,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chief Complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placenta previa and suspected placenta accreta in the setting of multiple prior cesarean deliveries; high risk for postpartum hemorrhage.,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ms. Jane Blank is a 38-year-old G9P6026 at 33w3d with six prior cesarean deliveries. Her most recent ultrasound demonstrates placenta previa with concerning findings for placenta accreta. She is undergoing anesthesia consultation due to increased risk for hemorrhage at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery. The patient has previously required blood transfusion after one of her cesarean deliveries and experienced bleeding with multiple prior surgeries. Her obstetrician has discussed the possibility of cesarean hysterectomy should placental separation not be possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ultrasound confirms normal fetal size and no evidence of polyhydramnios. The patient has no history of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, bleeding or clotting disorders, and is not on anticoagulation. Her most recent hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with a hematocrit of 33%. She has not experienced any bleeding in the current pregnancy.",Positive,Positive,,Negative,Negative,,Negative,,Negative,Positive,,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The patient has had six prior cesarean deliveries, all performed via low transverse uterine incision. She experienced bleeding with several of the procedures, one of which required transfusion. She has also had two dilation and curettage procedures following miscarriages. There is no history of uterine rupture, uterine inversion, myomectomy, or other uterine or pelvic surgeries. No history of in vitro fertilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The patient denies any significant past medical history aside from obstetric concerns. No cardiac or pulmonary disease, no asthma, and no medication allergies. She reports no complications with previous neuraxial anesthesia; all epidurals and spinal anesthetics have been effective. There is no personal or family history of anesthesia complications. She denies scoliosis or prior spinal surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 38-year-old G9P6026 at 33w3d with a history of six prior cesarean deliveries, current placenta previa, and ultrasound findings concerning for placenta accreta. She is at significantly increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage due to prior uterine surgery, suspected abnormal placentation, and prior transfusion history. She may require a cesarean hysterectomy depending on intraoperative findings.",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scheduled cesarean delivery,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possible cesarean hysterectomy based on placental separation and bleeding,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Preferred neuraxial anesthesia (likely combined spinal-epidural or longer-acting spinal),,,,,,,,,,,,
"Intraoperative conversion to general anesthesia if prolonged surgery, inadequate block, or hemodynamic instability arises",,,,,,,,,,,,
Final anesthetic plan to be determined by the anesthesia team on day of surgery in collaboration with OB,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient is a good candidate for neuraxial anesthesia given lack of contraindications,,,,,,,,,,,,
Combined spinal-epidural favored for flexibility and longer duration,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Risks of general anesthesia, airway instrumentation, and need for conversion were discussed and understood",,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring / Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plan for two large-bore IVs for volume resuscitation,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consider arterial line placement for real-time blood pressure monitoring if bleeding is substantial or pressures are labile,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ultrasound guidance for vascular access as needed,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No contraindications to standard uterotonic agents (oxytocin, methylergonovine, carboprost, misoprostol) or tranexamic acid",,,,,,,,,,,,
Use of uterotonics will be guided by intraoperative findings and OB teamâ€™s assessment of uterine tone and blood loss,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If general anesthesia or massive transfusion is required, anticipate ICU admission for close hemodynamic monitoring and ventilatory support",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Patient may remain intubated postoperatively if unstable, with plan for sedation and delayed extubation once stabilized",,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All aspects of the anesthesia plan, including potential need for blood transfusion, possible conversion to general anesthesia, and risk for cesarean hysterectomy, were discussed with the patient. She verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan. The anesthesia and obstetric teams will coordinate care on the day of delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
