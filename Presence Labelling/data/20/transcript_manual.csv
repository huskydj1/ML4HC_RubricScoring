00:00.000 --> 00:07.000,Hello. Good morning. This is Dr. Smith from the Brigham and Women's Hospital OB Anesthesia Team.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07.000 --> 00:19.000,I'm looking for Ms. Jane Blank. This is she. Hi there. Your OB team asked us to reach out with you to chat about some anesthesia related considerations given some of your history.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:19.000 --> 00:24.000,"Do you have 10 to 15 minutes to speak with us? Yeah. Great, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:24.000 --> 00:29.000,We've reviewed your chart and we'd just like to discuss some of the findings from your current pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:29.000 --> 00:44.000,"I know that in the past you had a history of a bleed with your prior. Yeah, I had a major experience with surgery and needed a lot of medications.",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:44.000 --> 00:50.000,"Blood transfusions, stayed in the hospital longer, so it was quite of an ordeal.",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:50.000 --> 00:53.000,"Yes, I'm sure it was a very overwhelming experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:53.000 --> 00:59.000,"Part of why we wanted to just discuss things to expect for this second C-section with you, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:59.000 --> 01:06.000,"Now, it looks like the current pregnancy, no signs of any placenta previa or accreta. Is that correct?",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,
01:06.000 --> 01:14.000,"Yes, I got an ultrasound and I believe my obstetrician said that everything looked good.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:14.000 --> 01:17.000,"Yes, looks like it from what we're seeing here as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:17.000 --> 01:22.000,"Looks like just baby's a little bit big, but otherwise fluid around baby is normal.",,,,Negative,Positive,,,,,,,
01:22.000 --> 01:23.000,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:23.000 --> 01:25.000,"Otherwise, how have you been doing in this pregnancy?",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:25.000 --> 01:26.000,I feel okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:26.000 --> 01:30.000,Okay. Any preeclampsia or high blood pressure in pregnancy?,,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
01:30.000 --> 01:31.000,No.,,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
01:31.000 --> 01:33.000,Any blood thinners that you're taking?,,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
01:33.000 --> 01:34.000,No blood thinners.,,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
01:34.000 --> 01:42.000,"Okay, great. And then I looked at your lab values, looks like everything looks pretty okay. Your hemoglobin and hematocrit are 11 and 34.",,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
01:42.000 --> 01:43.000,Uh-huh.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:43.000 --> 01:48.000,"Okay. We're going to just talk a little bit more about that last C-section, if that's okay with you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:48.000 --> 01:49.000,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:49.000 --> 01:51.000,"So you just had the one prior C-section, is that correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:51.000 --> 01:52.000,"Yeah, it was in this hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:52.000 --> 02:00.000,"Yes, I see that here in our records. And you had that section because you had a placenta previa, is that correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:00.000 --> 02:01.000,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:01.000 --> 02:09.000,"Got it. Now, it sounds like when they actually did the C-section that maybe there was a sign of some placenta accreta where it was a little bit more stuck than they thought.",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
02:09.000 --> 02:10.000,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:10.000 --> 02:13.000,Okay. And I know you had a bleed at that time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:13.000 --> 02:14.000,Uh-huh.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:14.000 --> 02:16.000,And you received a blood transfusion?,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:16.000 --> 02:17.000,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:17.000 --> 02:21.000,"Yes. It looks like you got four units of red blood cells, something called platelet.",,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
02:21.000 --> 02:27.000,"Two units of what's called plasma, two of what's called cryo, and one of platelets.",,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
02:27.000 --> 02:32.000,"And I know they did another procedure after the C-section itself, is that right?",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:32.000 --> 02:33.000,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:33.000 --> 02:34.000,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:34.000 --> 02:36.000,We needed to go back to the surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:36.000 --> 02:45.000,"Yes. So it looks like I see they did a balloon to help kind of with the bleeding, and then you went, did you go to the interventional radiology team to, for something?",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:45.000 --> 02:50.000,"Yeah, that was in a different, in a different place.",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:50.000 --> 03:00.000,"And I believe they had to embolize, they had to put something in my uterus to make the bleeding stop.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:00.000 --> 03:02.000,Yes. Yes. That's what we see here.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:02.000 --> 03:08.000,"But after that last procedure, no, sounds like everything was relatively stable. Is that correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:08.000 --> 03:11.000,Yeah. It just took me a long time to recover.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:11.000 --> 03:18.000,"Of course. That's a, you know, bigger bleeds like that can really lead to like a longer recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:18.000 --> 03:24.000,"Now, since then, you've had no episodes of bleeding. Is that correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:24.000 --> 03:28.000,Yes. Everything was fine eventually.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:28.000 --> 03:37.000,"Good. Other than that C-section and those procedures surrounding it, have you had any other procedures on your uterus?",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:37.000 --> 03:46.000,"I had a miscarriage with, in my first pregnancy. It was just found accidentally.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:46.000 --> 03:47.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:47.000 --> 03:53.000,"We were trying to get pregnant, and then all of a sudden I started bleeding. I didn't even know I was pregnant.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:53.000 --> 04:02.000,"But after I came to the hospital and had the procedure, I was okay and then got pregnant again right away.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:02.000 --> 04:11.000,"Okay. Very good. Any other surgeries on your uterus, like any like fibroid removals or any hysteroscopies, anything like that?",,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
04:11.000 --> 04:12.000,No.,,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
04:12.000 --> 04:16.000,Great. Any other surgeries in your abdomen or pelvis before?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:16.000 --> 04:17.000,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:17.000 --> 04:18.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:18.000 --> 04:24.000,Sounds good. Do you have any history of bleeding or clotting disorders otherwise?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:24.000 --> 04:32.000,No. It was just that one time after the C-section when I was bleeding. That was the only time in my life.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:32.000 --> 04:33.000,Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:33.000 --> 04:35.000,"Otherwise, I have been pretty healthy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:35.000 --> 04:41.000,Got it. And was this current pregnancy conceived with IVF?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:41.000 --> 04:42.000,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:42.000 --> 04:46.000,"It was. Okay. I'm just going to ask a little bit more about your baseline medical history, if that's okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:46.000 --> 04:48.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:48.000 --> 04:49.000,Do you have any heart problems?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:49.000 --> 04:50.000,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:50.000 --> 04:51.000,Any lung problems?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:51.000 --> 04:52.000,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:52.000 --> 04:58.000,"Great. Any asthma at all, as far as you're aware?",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:58.000 --> 05:00.000,No. Not asthma.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:00.000 --> 05:04.000,Great. And you've been doing okay with activities as pregnancy has progressed?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:04.000 --> 05:14.000,"Yeah. I mean, it's not so great, but I have been going to work and taking care of my son, so it has been okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:14.000 --> 05:15.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:15.000 --> 05:16.000,All things considered.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:16.000 --> 05:20.000,Glad to hear that. Do you have allergies to any medication?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:20.000 --> 05:21.000,No allergies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:21.000 --> 05:26.000,Great. Any history of issues with anesthesia for yourself?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:26.000 --> 05:27.000,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:27.000 --> 05:29.000,Great. Any family history of anesthesia problems?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:29.000 --> 05:30.000,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:30.000 --> 05:32.000,Perfect. Do you have any scoliosis?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:32.000 --> 05:33.000,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:33.000 --> 05:36.000,Any surgeries before on your back? Any hardware on your back?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:36.000 --> 05:37.000,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:37.000 --> 05:45.000,Perfect. Thank you for all that information. It's very helpful for all of us to just have that information so we can,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:45.000 --> 05:48.000,make the best plan to take good care of you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:48.000 --> 05:56.000,"As you know, because you had a bigger bleed during your first C-section, prior C-sections, prior history of bleeds,",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:56.000 --> 06:00.000,things like that can all increase your risk of bleeding during a subsequent C-section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:00.000 --> 06:06.000,So we just wanted to kind of discuss things to expect and our plans to help keep you safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:06.000 --> 06:15.000,"Now, as you know from your prior section, we usually do these surgeries under some kind of neuraxial anesthesia, meaning either a spinal",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:15.000 --> 06:18.000,or an epidural. Do you have a spinal with your first?,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:18.000 --> 06:25.000,"Yeah. I had a spinal, but they had to give me a little sedation because the surgery was very long.",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:25.000 --> 06:34.000,"I'm sure. So the plan would likely be fairly similar this time. You know, once you've had one prior C-section,",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:34.000 --> 06:39.000,sometimes after that they can take a little bit longer. So we'll probably either do like a longer acting spinal injection.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:39.000 --> 06:45.000,Sometimes they do what's called a combined spinal epidural where you get the spinal injection and we also thread in the,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:45.000 --> 06:50.000,little catheter into that space so that we can give you more medication if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:50.000 --> 07:00.000,"Now, the final discussion will depend on, you know, the OBs in the anesthesia team the day of, kind of discussing what they think is best for timing.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:00.000 --> 07:09.000,"Otherwise, because you have a higher than normal risk of bleeding, we'll just make sure that we have good access in terms of IVs.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:09.000 --> 07:15.000,"We'll probably do two of those. If needed, we might use an ultrasound if we don't see anything wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:15.000 --> 07:21.000,"Something super visible, just so we can get good IVs in and we can always give you some numbing medication for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:21.000 --> 07:26.000,"Okay. Yeah, it was difficult to get the IV last time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:26.000 --> 07:35.000,"Okay. So we can definitely take a look with the ultrasound if there's nothing super obvious. We don't want to poke you a bunch of times unnecessarily, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:35.000 --> 07:36.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:36.000 --> 07:41.000,"Now, we'll be communicating closely with the OB team during the procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:41.000 --> 07:45.000,"If there's any issues or we're concerned about your blood pressure,",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:45.000 --> 07:50.000,"or there's lots of bleeding, we might place what's called an arterial line that's similar to an IV,",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:50.000 --> 07:53.000,but it goes in the wrist and it monitors your blood pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:53.000 --> 07:54.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:54.000 --> 07:59.000,"Just like with those IVs, we might use an ultrasound. It might give you some numbing medication for that, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:59.000 --> 08:00.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:00.000 --> 08:03.000,"Okay. And like we said, we'll be there with you the whole time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
08:03.000 --> 08:07.000,We will kind of watch and listen to what the OBs are doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:07.000 --> 08:11.000,"If you have significant blood loss, we might need to give you a blood transfusion again.",,,,,,,,,,,,
08:11.000 --> 08:12.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:12.000 --> 08:13.000,Are you okay with that?,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:13.000 --> 08:14.000,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:14.000 --> 08:15.000,Okay. Very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:15.000 --> 08:19.000,"There's also some other medications we can give to help your uterus to contract a bit,",,,,,,,,,,,,
08:19.000 --> 08:20.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:20.000 --> 08:22.000,which can help with bleeding.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:22.000 --> 08:27.000,"Based on what I'm seeing here, there's no reason that you couldn't get any of those medications,",,,,,,,,,,,,
08:27.000 --> 08:30.000,"so we'll be there to administer those if needed, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
08:30.000 --> 08:31.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:31.000 --> 08:32.000,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:32.000 --> 08:36.000,I think I got a lot of medications and things last time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:36.000 --> 08:37.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:37.000 --> 08:38.000,So...,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:38.000 --> 08:44.000,"It looks like you got one called TXA, which helps, you know, prevent breakdown of clots,",,,,,,,,,,,,
08:44.000 --> 08:47.000,sometimes given these situations.,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:47.000 --> 08:54.000,"Now, if your bleeding is very significant or if the OB decides that they need to do",,,,,,,,,,,,
08:54.000 --> 08:58.000,"something a little bit more involved, then sometimes we will change our anesthesia plan,",,,,,,,,,,,,
08:58.000 --> 09:01.000,just kind of like you discussed in the prior C-section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:01.000 --> 09:02.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:02.000 --> 09:05.000,"So, you know, we might always convert to general anesthesia.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:05.000 --> 09:08.000,That's where you go completely to sleep with a breathing tube.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:08.000 --> 09:09.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:09.000 --> 09:12.000,Or sometimes we might just supplement a little bit with some more sedation on top of the,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:12.000 --> 09:13.000,existing spinal.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:13.000 --> 09:14.000,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:14.000 --> 09:15.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:15.000 --> 09:16.000,"Yeah, I think I had sedation last time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:16.000 --> 09:20.000,They gave me something because it was just long.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:20.000 --> 09:21.000,Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:21.000 --> 09:22.000,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:22.000 --> 09:24.000,"So, always a possibility this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:24.000 --> 09:28.000,"In the scenario where you go completely to sleep, we give you IV medications to make",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:28.000 --> 09:31.000,sure that you're completely out of it before we place a breathing tube.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:31.000 --> 09:34.000,"In those cases, you know, we just do that to protect your airway.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:34.000 --> 09:35.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:35.000 --> 09:36.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:36.000 --> 09:39.000,The plan in that situation is always to kind of take out the breathing tube at the end,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:39.000 --> 09:40.000,of the surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:40.000 --> 09:41.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:41.000 --> 09:42.000,"But if there's any issues at all, any concerns...",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:42.000 --> 09:43.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:43.000 --> 09:44.000,"...at all, or we need to stabilize you further with more medications or things, sometimes",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:44.000 --> 09:45.000,we leave you asleep and keep giving you medications once we're out of the operating room and take,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:45.000 --> 09:46.000,you to a monitored unit.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:46.000 --> 09:47.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:47.000 --> 09:48.000,"In that situation, you might wake up somewhere different than where you fall asleep.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:48.000 --> 09:49.000,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:49.000 --> 09:50.000,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:50.000 --> 09:51.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:51.000 --> 09:52.000,I don't anticipate that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:52.000 --> 09:53.000,Those are just things that we keep in mind to help keep you safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:53.000 --> 09:54.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:54.000 --> 09:55.000,What questions do you have about any of that?,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:55.000 --> 09:56.000,"Since my OB said that now, I don't have any symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:56.000 --> 09:57.000,I don't have any symptoms.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:57.000 --> 09:58.000,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:58.000 --> 09:59.000,I don't have any symptoms.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:59.000 --> 10:00.000,I don't have any symptoms.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:00.000 --> 10:01.000,I don't have any symptoms.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:01.000 --> 10:02.000,I don't have any symptoms.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:02.000 --> 10:03.000,I don't have any symptoms.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:03.000 --> 10:04.000,I don't have any symptoms.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:04.000 --> 10:18.800,"So, since my OB said that now the placenta looks okay, do you think the same problems",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:18.800 --> 10:22.980,"can happen as last time, or do you think this is now lower risk?",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:22.980 --> 10:25.760,"I think compared to last time, it's definitely lower risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:25.760 --> 10:30.540,"So, last time you had the placenta apremia and the accreta, which they didn't quite pick",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
10:30.540 --> 10:31.540,up on in the initial ultrasounds.,,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
10:31.540 --> 10:32.540,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:32.540 --> 10:33.540,That accreta's not always as easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:33.540 --> 10:33.980,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:33.980 --> 10:39.620,to see as the previa would be so I think it is lower risk but because you've,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:39.620 --> 10:43.220,already had an episode of bleeding and because you already had a c-section,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:43.220 --> 10:47.120,there's always a risk that you might have a bleed this time as well I would,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:47.120 --> 10:52.540,say lower than last time okay always a possibility that your placenta has still,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:52.540 --> 10:58.600,not attached quite the normal way okay and there's no everything's looked okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:58.600 --> 11:02.420,that's how we're prepared one way or another to make sure that we keep you,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:02.420 --> 11:09.180,safe okay okay any other questions right now no I think you explained,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:09.180 --> 11:13.640,everything well great before you hang up we'll briefly have you speak with dr.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:13.640 --> 11:17.200,Jones who's going to be attending anesthesiologist here at the Brigham,,,,,,,,,,,,
