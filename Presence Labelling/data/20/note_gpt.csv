High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 32,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRN: 000000019,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G3P1011,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 33w3d,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiple Gestation: No (singleton pregnancy),,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,
History of significant postpartum hemorrhage during prior cesarean delivery; consult for anesthetic planning and bleeding risk management for upcoming scheduled cesarean.,,,,,,,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms. Jane Blank is a 32-year-old G3P1011 at 33w3d gestation with a singleton pregnancy. She is scheduled for a repeat cesarean delivery and presents for a high-risk obstetric anesthesia consultation due to a prior history of severe postpartum hemorrhage. Her first pregnancy resulted in a cesarean section at this institution due to placenta previa, complicated by suspected undiagnosed placenta accreta. Intraoperatively, she experienced significant hemorrhage requiring multiple transfusions and postoperative interventional radiology embolization to control bleeding. She reports prolonged recovery but no further bleeding episodes during that or subsequent pregnancies.",Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
"For this pregnancy, imaging shows normal placental positioning without evidence of previa or accreta. There is no polyhydramnios, and fetal growth is mildly elevated. She reports no vaginal bleeding in the current pregnancy.",,,,Negative,,,,,,,,
Her latest hemoglobin is 11 g/dL and hematocrit is 34%. She is not on anticoagulation and denies a personal or family history of bleeding or clotting disorders.,,,,,,,,,Negative,Positive,,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One prior cesarean delivery for placenta previa, complicated by suspected placenta accreta, intraoperative hemorrhage requiring:",Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
"Transfusion of 4 units RBCs, 2 units FFP, 2 units cryoprecipitate, and 1 unit platelets",,,,,,,,,,,,
Return to the OR for intrauterine balloon placement,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interventional radiology embolization procedure,,,,,,,,,,,,
One first-trimester miscarriage treated with D&C,,,,,,,,,,,,
No history of uterine rupture or uterine inversion,,,,,,,,,,,,
No other pelvic or abdominal surgeries,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
No known allergies,,,,,,,,,,,,
No prior anesthesia complications,,,,,,,,,,,,
No family history of anesthesia reactions,,,,,,,,,,,,
No scoliosis or back surgeries,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Denies cardiopulmonary disease, asthma, or hypertension",,,,,,,,,,,,
IVF conception for current pregnancy,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Functionally active though more fatigued in late pregnancy, able to care for child and continue working",,,,,,,,,,,,
Reports difficult IV access in prior surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,
Physical Exam: Deferred—telehealth consultation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 32-year-old G3P1011 at 33w3d with a history of placenta previa and possible undiagnosed accreta in her prior pregnancy, leading to massive postpartum hemorrhage requiring multi-product transfusion, uterine balloon tamponade, and IR embolization. Though her current pregnancy shows no placental abnormalities, her prior surgical history places her at elevated risk of recurrent hemorrhage during her upcoming cesarean delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scheduled repeat cesarean section,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anticipate potential for hemorrhage due to prior surgical history,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Neuraxial anesthesia preferred,,,,,,,,,,,,
Likely combined spinal-epidural or extended-duration spinal,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consider sedation if operative time prolonged,,,,,,,,,,,,
General anesthesia as backup if neuraxial is inadequate or if emergent complications arise,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient is an appropriate candidate for neuraxial block,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sedation may be used to supplement neuraxial technique as needed,,,,,,,,,,,,
"General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation may be required in event of hemodynamic instability, prolonged surgery, or emergent hysterectomy",,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring / Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two large-bore peripheral IVs recommended,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ultrasound-guided IV placement due to history of difficult access,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arterial line may be placed intraoperatively if significant bleeding or hemodynamic instability occurs,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No contraindications to oxytocin, methylergonovine, carboprost, misoprostol, or tranexamic acid",,,,,,,,,,,,
Will be administered as needed to optimize uterine tone and minimize blood loss,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Potential need for ICU-level monitoring if significant transfusion, hemodynamic instability, or general anesthesia occurs",,,,,,,,,,,,
Possibility of remaining intubated postoperatively if not medically stable for extubation,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient Counseling:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussed elevated bleeding risk and steps to minimize complications,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient agrees to blood transfusion if needed,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reviewed risks and benefits of anesthesia options; all questions addressed and patient expressed understanding,,,,,,,,,,,,
