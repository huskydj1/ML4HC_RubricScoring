High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient Name: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 35,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRN: 000000008,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G3P2002,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 30w5d,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pregnancy Type: Singleton,,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placenta accreta; history of large-for-gestational-age infants and uterine fibroids; high risk for peripartum hemorrhage.,,Positive,,,Positive,Positive,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ms. Jane Blank is a 35-year-old G3P2002 at 30w5d with two prior cesarean deliveries.,,,,,,,,,,,,
She is being evaluated via telephone for a high-risk obstetric anesthesia consult due to concern for placenta accreta and increased hemorrhage risk at the time of delivery.,,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
"Ultrasound findings suggest placental implantation into the uterine scar from her previous C-sections, consistent with accreta spectrum.",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
She does not have placenta previa.,Negative,,,,,,,,,,,
Her current pregnancy is also notable for fetal macrosomia and uterine fibroids.,,,,,Positive,Positive,,,,,,
Laboratory data show hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL and hematocrit of 32%.,,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
The patient is scheduled to receive intravenous iron therapy due to intolerance of oral supplementation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Platelet count is within normal limits at 164 x10⁹/L.,,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
She has no vaginal bleeding during this pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
She had preeclampsia during her first pregnancy but has remained normotensive during this and her previous pregnancy while on daily low-dose aspirin.,,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms. Blank has had two prior cesarean deliveries: the first unplanned following a trial of labor, and the second scheduled. The first delivery was performed under epidural anesthesia, and the second under spinal anesthesia. She tolerated both anesthetics well without complications. She denies excessive bleeding or transfusion during either delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
She has a history of one hysteroscopic myomectomy and known uterine fibroids.,,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
"No prior D&Cs, uterine rupture, inversion, or classical uterine incisions are reported or suspected.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her past medical history is significant for preeclampsia in her first pregnancy and uterine fibroids.,,,,,,Positive,Positive,,,,,
"She reports no history of asthma, cardiac or pulmonary disease, bleeding or clotting disorders, or other major comorbidities.",,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
She is allergic to penicillin (childhood rash).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She denies scoliosis, spinal hardware, or prior back surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
No personal or family history of anesthesia complications.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She reports mild pregnancy-related fatigue but no dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or presyncope.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Her activity level remains appropriate for gestation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Physical exam: Deferred due to phone consultation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 35-year-old G3P2002 at 30w5d with two prior cesarean sections and a current pregnancy complicated by suspected placenta accreta, history of fetal macrosomia, and uterine fibroids.",,Positive,,,Positive,Positive,,,,,,
"She also has a history of preeclampsia and is currently anemic, requiring IV iron.",,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
These factors collectively place her at high risk for postpartum hemorrhage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hysterectomy at the time of delivery is a possible contingency.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Scheduled cesarean delivery,,,,,,,,,,,,
• High suspicion for placenta accreta; hysterectomy possible depending on intraoperative findings,,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Neuraxial anesthesia preferred (likely combined spinal-epidural to allow for surgical prolongation),,,,,,,,,,,,
"• General anesthesia may be required if surgical course is prolonged, bleeding is excessive, or hysterectomy is performed",,,,,,,,,,,,
• Risks and indications for possible conversion to general anesthesia discussed,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Combined spinal-epidural planned for optimal intraoperative coverage,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Spinal alone may be considered depending on intraoperative context,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Patient has tolerated both epidural and spinal anesthesia well in prior deliveries,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• If general anesthesia is required, patient will be sedated prior to intubation and appropriately monitored",,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring/Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Two large-bore IVs to be placed preoperatively,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Ultrasound guidance may be used to aid vascular access,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Arterial line may be placed intraoperatively if significant bleeding occurs or for continuous blood pressure monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Avoid methylergonovine due to history of preeclampsia,,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
"• Will utilize oxytocin, carboprost, misoprostol, and tranexamic acid as needed",,,,,,,,,,,,
• No contraindications to antifibrinolytic therapy,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Patient may require postoperative ICU admission if significant bleeding, transfusion, or hysterectomy occurs",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• If intubated intraoperatively, she may remain sedated and ventilated until stabilized for extubation",,,,,,,,,,,,
• Plans discussed regarding family presence and baby’s care in the event of general anesthesia and surgical complications,,,,,,,,,,,,
All questions were addressed during the call.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The patient voiced understanding of the risks and plan, and agreed to the outlined approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,
