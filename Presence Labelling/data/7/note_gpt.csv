High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient Name: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 35,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRN: 000000006,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G2P1001,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 31w0d,,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Singleton Pregnancy,,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placenta previa in a patient with prior severe postpartum hemorrhage requiring multiple surgical interventions and transfusion.,,,,,,,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ms. Jane Blank is a 35-year-old G2P1001 at 31 weeks gestation with a singleton pregnancy and a history of placenta previa in the current pregnancy.,Positive,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
She is being evaluated for a high-risk anesthetic plan given significant obstetric history and current findings.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Her prior delivery was complicated by a postpartum hemorrhage of approximately 2000 mL, requiring uterotonics, blood transfusion, dilation and curettage (D&C), and uterine artery embolization.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Current prenatal imaging shows placenta previa without evidence of accreta.,Positive,Negative,,,,,,,,,,
"There is no polyhydramnios, but the fetus is reportedly large for gestational age.",,,,Negative,Positive,,,,,,,
Additional comorbidities include uterine fibroids and prior preeclampsia.,,,,,,Positive,Positive,,,,,
"Recent labs show a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL and hematocrit of 28%, consistent with anemia.",,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
The patient has a normal platelet count (220k) and denies active vaginal bleeding during this pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The patient has had one prior term vaginal delivery, complicated by preeclampsia requiring induction and subsequent severe postpartum hemorrhage.",,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
"The initial bleed occurred immediately postpartum, treated with uterotonics and blood transfusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Five days postpartum, she returned with delayed hemorrhage requiring D&C and subsequent uterine artery embolization.",,,,,,,,,,,,
There was no known placenta accreta or uterine rupture.,,Negative,,,,,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
Past medical history includes:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Preeclampsia (prior pregnancy only),,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
•	Anemia (current pregnancy),,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Uterine fibroids (no prior intervention),,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
"•	No chronic hypertension, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or thromboembolic disease",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	No known bleeding or clotting disorders,,,,,,,,,,,,Negative
•	No drug allergies,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	No scoliosis or prior spine surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia history:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Epidural in prior labor, with minor breakthrough pain responsive to top-ups",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	No personal or family history of anesthesia complications,,,,,,,,,,,,
Functional status:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Mild fatigue and shortness of breath typical of pregnancy,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	No limitations in basic activity or ambulation,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 35-year-old G2P1001 at 31w0d with current placenta previa and a significant obstetric history notable for postpartum hemorrhage following vaginal delivery, requiring transfusion, D&C, and uterine artery embolization.",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
"Her risk of hemorrhage is elevated due to the placenta previa, history of severe delayed postpartum hemorrhage, uterine fibroids, and anemia.",,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
Methylergonovine will be avoided due to history of preeclampsia.,,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Scheduled cesarean delivery due to placenta previa.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Neuraxial anesthesia preferred: likely spinal or combined spinal-epidural depending on intraoperative complexity and expected duration.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	General anesthesia to be used if neuraxial block is inadequate or in the setting of hemodynamic instability or emergency (e.g., hysterectomy or massive hemorrhage).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Patient is a suitable candidate for neuraxial anesthesia.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Spinal or CSE will be performed using appropriate technique, and the patient has expressed a preference to remain awake if possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Conversion to general anesthesia discussed if required for safety.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring/Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Two large-bore IVs to be placed preoperatively; ultrasound guidance and local anesthesia to facilitate placement as needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Arterial line to be considered intraoperatively based on blood loss or instability.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Continuous hemodynamic and blood loss monitoring throughout.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Avoid methylergonovine due to preeclampsia history.,,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
"•	Carboprost, misoprostol, oxytocin, and tranexamic acid available and appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Blood products to be crossmatched and available intraoperatively; patient consents to transfusion if necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	If stable, routine recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	If significant bleeding or transfusion needs arise, patient may require ICU-level care for continued hemodynamic support and/or delayed extubation if general anesthesia is used.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient has been counseled extensively regarding elevated risk of hemorrhage and the anesthetic plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All questions were answered, and the patient is aware of and agrees with the proposed approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation of this discussion will be available to the peripartum care team.,,,,,,,,,,,,
