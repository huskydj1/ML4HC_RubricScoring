[00:00.000 --> 00:07.160]: Hello. Good morning. This is Dr. Smith from the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Good morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:07.160 --> 00:15.040]: Good morning. Looking for Ms. Jane Blank. This is Shea. Great. We're just calling from the Brigham,,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:15.040 --> 00:21.440]: and Women's anesthesia team. Your obstetrician asked us to reach out to you to chat about some,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:21.440 --> 00:27.480]: anesthesia related considerations. Do you have about 15 minutes to speak with us? Yeah, Dr.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:27.480 --> 00:34.640]: Johnson said that someone from your team will call. Perfect. So we've reviewed your chart. We'd,,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:34.640 --> 00:38.620]: just like to discuss some of the findings from your current pregnancy and some of your history,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:38.620 --> 00:45.620]: from your prior pregnancy, if that's okay. Yes. Great. So I see that the ultrasound shows that",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:45.620 --> 00:51.340]: your uterus is implanted in an abnormal way, so you have a placenta previa. Is that correct?",Positive,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
"[00:51.340 --> 00:53.880]: Yeah, I have placenta previa.",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:56.240 --> 00:57.460]: Otherwise, from the ultrasound?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:57.480 --> 01:03.560]: It looks like there's no placenta accreta. Is that right? No. There's no extra fluid around,,Negative,,Negative,,,,,,,,
[01:03.560 --> 01:10.020]: baby. No. But it does sound like baby's pretty big. Is that right? Yeah. My previous was almost,,,,,Positive,,,,,,,
[01:10.020 --> 01:16.600]: 10 pounds. Oh my goodness. Okay. Got it. And I do see you also have some fibroids. Is that right?,,,,,Positive,Positive,,,,,,
"[01:18.100 --> 01:23.840]: Yeah, but that has not been a problem. Got it. You've never had a procedure for that?",,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
"[01:24.280 --> 01:27.440]: No. Okay. In this pregnancy,",,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
"[01:27.480 --> 01:34.800]: do you have anything called preeclampsia? No, not this time. But I had a severe",,,Negative,,,,Negative,,,,,
[01:34.800 --> 01:45.240]: high blood pressures in my last pregnancy. Okay. I see. Got it. Is that... So did you,,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:45.240 --> 01:53.660]: have an induction for the preeclampsia? Yeah. I had to... I also got a lot of medications.,,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.360]: Okay. Got it. It's very common when your blood pressure gets...,,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:57.480 --> 02:03.400]: very high with preeclampsia yeah um do you use any blood thinners in this pregnancy um i just,,,Negative,,,,Negative,,Positive,,,
[02:03.400 --> 02:10.940]: take a baby aspirin so far it's been okay okay very good i'm just looking at your labs here i,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
[02:10.940 --> 02:16.120]: see you had some blood tests looks like your hemoglobin and hematocrit are 9 and 28 which are,,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
[02:16.120 --> 02:28.780]: on the lower side yeah i had anemia and my doctor wanted me to take iron but i could not take it,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:28.780 --> 02:37.840]: it just irritates my stomach okay i see um it does look like your platelet count is 220 which is,,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
[02:37.840 --> 02:43.120]: good and within normal limits yeah okay uh we're just going to ask a little bit more about your,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:43.120 --> 02:44.980]: prior delivery if that's okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:44.980 --> 02:45.480]: um,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:46.120 --> 02:52.220]: it was just one prior vaginal delivery is that right yeah okay um did you have an epidural with,,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:52.220 --> 03:01.380]: that yeah i wasn't planning to have it but um it was a long induction and eventually i i had to,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:01.380 --> 03:06.260]: take it okay i see did you have any problems with the epidural or did it work well for you,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:06.260 --> 03:13.140]: um it it worked mostly okay okay yeah there there were a few times when i had pain but,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:13.140 --> 03:16.100]: they gave me medication and it was okay okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:16.120 --> 03:21.620]: i'm glad that it worked when they gave you extra medication um i understand you had some bleeding,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:21.620 --> 03:28.120]: after your first delivery uh yes yes so it sounds like you had some bleeding right away is that,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:28.120 --> 03:37.300]: right yeah okay it seems like the placenta was kind of holding on to the uterus a little bit,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:37.300 --> 03:44.480]: more adhered than usual yeah that happened so it's gonna kind of go through the sequence it,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:44.480 --> 03:46.100]: looks like you bled about two liters in the first delivery and then you had some bleeding right away,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:46.120 --> 03:53.400]: initially and you got some medications for that uh yes called transexamic acid and carboprost,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:53.400 --> 04:00.680]: i i don't remember okay there was just a lot going on yeah i'm sure you were very exhausted,,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:00.680 --> 04:07.880]: yeah um but you went home then it sounds like in five days later you came back yeah i was i,,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:07.880 --> 04:15.800]: was started bleeding all of a sudden at home uh and it was a lot of blood so they told me to come,,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:16.120 --> 04:23.240]: to the hospital okay uh it's i see when you got in it showed that your blood counts were much lower,,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:23.240 --> 04:29.880]: your hemoglobin is 6.8 which is pretty low um yeah they had to give me a blood transfusion,,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
[04:31.080 --> 04:37.240]: i was just not feeling well okay yeah see that they gave you a unit of red blood cells,,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:37.240 --> 04:45.480]: and they also did a procedure where they used the ultrasound to do a dnc bleeding initially yeah and,,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:46.120 --> 04:52.840]: i had to have another procedure uh next day there was just so much bleeding that,,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:53.560 --> 05:03.800]: they had to take me to the radiation suite okay yes i see here on post part of day six you went,,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:03.800 --> 05:08.760]: for what's called a uterine artery embolization where they yeah arteries to stop bleeding is that,,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:08.760 --> 05:16.040]: yeah yeah okay after that all of that which i know is a lot sounds like no further bleeding is that right,,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:16.120 --> 05:24.280]: uh yeah um i was sent home the next day okay and it was mostly okay okay i know that's all,,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:24.280 --> 05:31.080]: very overwhelming to happen yeah it was a lot yeah um otherwise it looks like um,,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:32.680 --> 05:39.400]: no history of any uterine rupture or inversion during that delivery right no great um no known,,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:39.400 --> 05:45.960]: history at the time of any placenta accreta as far as you were aware prior to to delivery,,Negative,,,,,,,,,,
[05:46.120 --> 05:51.960]: okay i was not told any of this okay do you have any bleeding or clotting disorders otherwise no,,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:52.600 --> 05:56.920]: great um it sounds like just was that the only time you've had a blood transfusion,,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:57.480 --> 06:05.800]: yes i was always healthy okay um did you use ivf for this pregnancy no okay i'm going to ask a,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:05.800 --> 06:11.960]: little bit more about your other medical history okay okay um do you have any heart problems,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:11.960 --> 06:15.480]: no any lung problems no great any,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:16.120 --> 06:20.700]: You mentioned that in the prior pregnancy you had the preeclampsia and the high blood pressures.,,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
"[06:21.700 --> 06:24.260]: But not at all during this pregnancy, is that right?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:24.400 --> 06:27.320]: Yeah, this pregnancy has been good so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:27.480 --> 06:29.900]: And no other high blood pressures outside of pregnancy?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:30.120 --> 06:30.320]: No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:30.760 --> 06:32.480]: Okay. Any asthma?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:32.840 --> 06:33.140]: No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:33.900 --> 06:36.160]: And how are you doing right now with activity levels?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:37.080 --> 06:43.480]: I get a little tired and short of breath, but I guess that's normal for pregnancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:43.480 --> 06:47.860]: You're able to go through your daily activities without too much difficulty?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:48.600 --> 06:51.620]: Okay, very good. Are you allergic to any medication?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:52.440 --> 06:54.180]: No, not that I know of.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:54.280 --> 07:00.220]: Okay, good. Any personal history or history in the family of anesthesia-related problems?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:00.500 --> 07:00.900]: No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:01.340 --> 07:03.580]: Great. Do you have any scoliosis in your back?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:03.920 --> 07:04.320]: No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:04.820 --> 07:07.040]: Any prior back surgeries or hardware?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:07.420 --> 07:07.800]: No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:07.800 --> 07:12.060]: Great. Okay, thank you for all of that information.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:13.480 --> 07:18.380]: It's so important for us to have all that so that we can do everything we can to take excellent care of you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:19.560 --> 07:25.560]: So, because of some of your history, really, notably the history of the bleed during your last delivery,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:25.920 --> 07:32.680]: as well as the placenta pre-P itself, you have a higher than normal risk of bleeding during this delivery.",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:34.220 --> 07:34.400]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:34.720 --> 07:39.800]: Because of all that, we want to make sure you have a good plan before your C-section and make sure you know what to expect.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:40.040 --> 07:40.300]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:40.300 --> 07:40.740]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:42.360 --> 07:43.300]: So, because...",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:43.480 --> 07:47.520]: Because of the placenta pre-P, it sounds like the plan is most likely for a cesarean section. Is that right?",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:47.560 --> 07:52.440]: Yes. The doctor said that this time it will be a C-section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:52.800 --> 08:00.440]: Yes. I know you've never been through that before, so we'll talk to you a little bit about the anesthesia for that kind of procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:00.740 --> 08:01.040]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:02.820 --> 08:08.320]: So, we typically do these under what's called neuraxial anesthesia, which means epidural or spinal.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:08.940 --> 08:10.420]: I know you're familiar with the epidural.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:10.420 --> 08:11.420]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:11.560 --> 08:12.420]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:13.480 --> 08:17.480]: So, typically for a scheduled cesarean section, we prefer a spinal injection.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:17.480 --> 08:23.480]: It's effectively a single-shot injection that makes you numb from the chest area down,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:23.480 --> 08:27.480]: so that they're able to do surgery on you without you having any pain or discomfort.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:27.480 --> 08:28.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:28.480 --> 08:31.480]: Am I going to go to sleep for that?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:31.480 --> 08:33.480]: The plan is we typically do not.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:33.480 --> 08:34.480]: Oh, okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:34.480 --> 08:41.480]: Typically, we have it so that you're awake and breathing on your own, but that you're numb and not having any pain during the surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:41.480 --> 08:42.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:42.480 --> 08:43.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:43.480 --> 08:49.480]: So, you're kind of aware and can kind of see baby when baby's born and things like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:49.480 --> 08:50.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:50.480 --> 08:51.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:51.480 --> 08:53.480]: Yeah, I prefer to be awake.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:53.480 --> 08:55.480]: Yes, we prefer that as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:57.480 --> 09:01.480]: So, as we mentioned, typically we do a spinal injection.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:01.480 --> 09:11.480]: Sometimes, if things might take a little bit longer or be a bit more complex, we, in addition to doing the spinal injection, we also thread in an epidural catheter.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:11.480 --> 09:12.480]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:12.480 --> 09:15.480]: To extend the length of time that you're numb.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:15.480 --> 09:19.480]: The team that they have will discuss that in more detail with you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:19.480 --> 09:20.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:20.480 --> 09:22.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:22.480 --> 09:29.480]: Now, because you have a higher than normal risk of bleeding, we want to make sure that we have good IVs for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:29.480 --> 09:30.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:30.480 --> 09:35.480]: As you know, we always place at least one so we can give fluids and medications during the process.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:35.480 --> 09:41.480]: But we will likely place a second IV so that we're able to give you more fluids or blood if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:41.480 --> 09:45.480]: Yeah, they poked me a lot last time when I was bleeding.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:45.480 --> 09:46.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:46.480 --> 09:47.480]: Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:47.480 --> 09:51.480]: We like to make sure we have good access so we can avoid doing that while you're in the midst of a bleed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:51.480 --> 09:52.480]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:52.480 --> 09:53.480]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:53.480 --> 09:54.480]: I understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:54.480 --> 10:02.480]: Especially if you have difficult IV access, we might use an ultrasound to help find some bigger veins and give some numbing medication so we can get some good IVs in.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:02.480 --> 10:03.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:03.480 --> 10:04.480]: Normally, I am not.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:04.480 --> 10:05.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:05.480 --> 10:09.480]: When I go to have blood trials, everything is okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:09.480 --> 10:10.480]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:10.480 --> 10:15.480]: It was just that one time last time when it was many pokes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:15.480 --> 10:16.480]: I see.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:16.480 --> 10:23.480]: That can happen sometimes, especially if you're actively bleeding and the blood vessels are a little bit smaller.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:23.480 --> 10:28.480]: And also, sometimes you get more swollen when you're in labor and you have preeclampsia.",,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
[10:28.480 --> 10:29.480]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:29.480 --> 10:31.480]: I was very puffy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:31.480 --> 10:32.480]: Right.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:32.480 --> 10:34.480]: Hopefully not a problem again this time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:34.480 --> 10:35.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:35.480 --> 10:36.480]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:36.480 --> 10:39.480]: But we'll make sure that we have everything to make it as smooth as possible for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:39.480 --> 10:40.480]: Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:40.480 --> 10:41.480]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:41.480 --> 10:46.480]: So now, we'll be communicating closely with your OB team about blood loss during the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:46.480 --> 10:55.480]: If it's significant, we might give a variety of medications to help your uterus contract or to help prevent the breakdown of clots in the blood.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:55.480 --> 11:05.480]: Now, based on your history, one of them we might not use, methogen is a medication that we tend to avoid if people have a history of higher blood pressures.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:05.480 --> 11:07.480]: Since you have a history in the prior delivery, we might not use methogen.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:07.480 --> 11:08.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:08.480 --> 11:09.480]: But we'll use things that we think are safe to help your uterus to contract and help prevent bleeding.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:09.480 --> 11:10.480]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:10.480 --> 11:11.480]: Please keep me safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:11.480 --> 11:12.480]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:12.480 --> 11:13.480]: That's our number one priority is to keep you safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:13.480 --> 11:14.480]: Now, I know you've had a blood transfusion in the past.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:14.480 --> 11:15.480]: Always a possibility of needing to do that again if you have significant bleeding.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:15.480 --> 11:16.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:16.480 --> 11:17.480]: We'll only do that if we need to based on your blood loss.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:17.480 --> 11:18.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:18.480 --> 11:19.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:19.480 --> 11:20.480]: Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:20.480 --> 11:21.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:21.480 --> 11:22.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:22.480 --> 11:23.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:23.480 --> 11:24.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:24.480 --> 11:25.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:25.480 --> 11:26.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:26.480 --> 11:27.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:27.480 --> 11:28.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:28.480 --> 11:29.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:29.480 --> 11:30.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:30.480 --> 11:31.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:31.480 --> 11:32.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:32.480 --> 11:33.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:33.480 --> 11:34.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:34.480 --> 11:35.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:35.480 --> 11:36.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:36.480 --> 11:37.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:37.480 --> 11:38.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:38.480 --> 11:39.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:39.480 --> 11:40.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:40.480 --> 11:41.480]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:41.480 --> 11:42.480]: Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:42.480 --> 11:43.480]: Very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:43.480 --> 11:44.480]: Now, if your bleeding is very significant, we might need to have a little bit closer",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:44.480 --> 11:49.480]: monitoring of your blood pressure, so sometimes we might place what's called an arterial line,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:49.480 --> 11:55.320]: which is a special IV that goes into the artery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:55.320 --> 12:00.320]: Typically it's in your wrist, but it monitors your blood pressure on a beach to beach basis",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:00.320 --> 12:01.280]: rather than cycling the cuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:01.280 --> 12:06.440]: If we need to place that, we will, but we'll give you a heads up before that happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:06.440 --> 12:07.440]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:07.440 --> 12:11.100]: Now, our hope is that you're able to stay awake through everything and that bleeding",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:11.100 --> 12:16.760]: is not too significant, but if it becomes very significant and you're a little less",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:16.760 --> 12:24.600]: stable than usual, or if the OB needs to do more interventions such as working on removing",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:24.600 --> 12:28.840]: the uterus, we may need to convert our anesthesia plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:28.840 --> 12:29.840]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:29.840 --> 12:30.840]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:30.840 --> 12:37.080]: In those cases, we will often convert to what's called general anesthesia, where you're asleep.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:37.080 --> 12:41.020]: Sometimes you're asleep, you place a breathing tube that helps make sure that your airway",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:41.020 --> 12:44.660]: is protected and that you get good oxygen flow.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:44.660 --> 12:49.980]: I really prefer to stay awake, so I hope that that doesn't happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:49.980 --> 12:55.800]: That's our hope too, and in all likelihood, it all will be straightforward, but we always",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:55.800 --> 13:01.400]: like to make a plan to make sure that we're prepared for all the possible scenarios.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:01.400 --> 13:02.400]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:02.400 --> 13:03.400]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:03.400 --> 13:07.060]: Now, if we do go down the road where you go to sleep, the plan is always to make sure",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:07.060 --> 13:13.460]: that you're able to only be asleep during the surgery itself, but if you're still having",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:13.460 --> 13:20.100]: some bleeding or needing some more fluids in order to become stable, we might keep you",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:20.100 --> 13:26.680]: asleep with the breathing tube in and send you to a monitoring unit after the surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:26.680 --> 13:29.820]: In that case, you would be asleep with the breathing tube until everything is stable,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:29.820 --> 13:33.000]: then they would wake you up and take it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:35.000 --> 13:36.000]: Again, that's very unlikely.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]: We want to have all the possibilities in the backs of our minds, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]: Regardless, we'll keep you safe and comfortable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]: That was a lot of information, and it can be very overwhelming.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]: What questions do you have for me?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:45.000 --> 13:56.360]: I don't have any questions right now, but I'm sure that when I come for the surgery,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:56.360 --> 13:57.360]: I will have many.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:57.360 --> 13:58.360]: Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:58.360 --> 14:03.360]: We can always discuss any of these things the morning of your surgery, so if you think",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14:03.360 --> 14:06.400]: of any questions in the meantime, you can also let your OB know.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:06.400 --> 14:06.900]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]: Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]: Of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]: Before we let you go, I'll briefly have you speak with Dr. Jones, who's one of our attending",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]: anesthesiologists here at the Brigham and Women's, if that's okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]: Great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]: Hi, Ms. Blank.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]: This is Dr. Jones.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]: I'm one of the obstetric anesthesiologists here at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]: Hi.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]: Hi there.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]: I read your chart, and I was listening along to your conversation with Dr. Smith.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]: It sounds like he mentioned some of our considerations for patients who have a higher risk of pulmonary,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]: bleeding.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]: I just wanted to make sure that you don't have any more questions about anything before,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]: we hang up with you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]: I wanted to think a little bit about it, but I'm sure that when I come for the surgery,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]: I will have some questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]: That's totally to be expected, and we're happy to answer any of those the day of your surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]: Great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]: We'll document everything we discussed in this phone call in a note in your chart so,,,,,,,,,,,,
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]: that the team taking care of you on that day knows what we said.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]: Otherwise, that should be it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]: As we said, we'll be sure to keep you safe and comfortable, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]: Thank you so much for talking to me and explaining everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]: Of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]: It's our pleasure.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]: Have a nice day.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]: Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]: Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]: Bye-bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
