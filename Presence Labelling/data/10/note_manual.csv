High-Risk Anesthesia Consultation Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRN: 000000009,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 44,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G4P0030,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 30w0d,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pregnancy Type: Singleton,,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placenta accreta spectrum; history of multiple uterine surgeries; high-risk cesarean delivery planning with concern for significant hemorrhage and possible hysterectomy.,,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms. Jane Blank is a 44-year-old G4P0030 at 30 weeks gestation with a singleton pregnancy, referred for high-risk obstetric anesthesia consultation due to placenta accreta spectrum identified on imaging.",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
"Additional concerning features include a history of multiple uterine procedures, large uterine fibroids, and a first planned cesarean delivery.",,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
"She reports no history of preeclampsia, clotting or bleeding disorders, or transfusion needs in the past.",,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
"Current labs reveal a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL and hematocrit of 27%, with platelet count at 140k.",,,,,,,,,,Positive,Positive,
She takes prenatal vitamins and iron supplementation for anemia and daily low-dose aspirin.,,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
Her pregnancy was achieved via IVF following multiple miscarriages.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She expresses significant concern about perioperative pain control, particularly given a history of chronic abdominal pain, Crohn’s disease, and prior postsurgical pain with intolerance to IV dilaudid.",,,,,,,,,,,,
She reports that morphine has worked well in the past and would prefer to avoid dilaudid if IV opioids are required.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Prior Cesarean Sections: None; this will be her first delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Prior Vaginal Deliveries: None.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Pregnancy Losses: Three miscarriages managed with D&C.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Conception Method: IVF following infertility treatment.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Uterine Surgeries: Two hysteroscopic myomectomies and one open abdominal myomectomy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Additional Abdominal Surgeries: Multiple abdominal surgeries for Crohn’s disease; currently with a functioning ostomy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Uterine Anomaly: Large fibroids persist throughout pregnancy.,,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Medical History: Crohn’s disease (on medical management), asthma (mild, inhaler use PRN), chronic abdominal pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Medications: Prenatal vitamins, iron supplementation, daily low-dose aspirin, PRN albuterol.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Allergies: No known drug allergies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Anesthesia History: No prior anesthesia complications; morphine well-tolerated, dilaudid caused significant nausea.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Pain History: Requires higher-than-average pain medication doses; experiences chronic pain flare-ups related to GI surgeries.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Social/Functional Status: Reports good functional capacity during pregnancy; no chest pain, dyspnea, or syncopal symptoms.",,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
"•	Spinal Assessment: No history of scoliosis, spinal surgery, or hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Physical Exam: Deferred – telephone consultation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms. Blank is at elevated risk for postpartum hemorrhage due to multiple risk factors: suspected placenta accreta spectrum, large fibroids, extensive history of uterine instrumentation and abdominal surgeries, IVF pregnancy, and anemia. These factors significantly increase the complexity of her scheduled cesarean delivery and the potential need for hysterectomy.", ,Positive,,,,Positive,,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Obstetric Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Scheduled cesarean delivery with multidisciplinary coordination.,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: OB team is aware of potential for prolonged case and possible hysterectomy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"o: Primary: Neuraxial anesthesia, likely combined spinal-epidural (CSE) or long-acting spinal.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"o: Secondary: General anesthesia if needed for prolonged surgery, inadequate block, hemodynamic instability, or hysterectomy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Anesthesia/Analgesia:,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Neuraxial agents for intraoperative anesthesia and early postoperative analgesia.,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Avoid IV dilaudid due to prior intolerance. Morphine preferred if opioids are required.,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Consider multimodal postoperative pain regimen including PCA if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Adjust postoperative pain plan for chronic pain baseline and Crohn’s-related abdominal sensitivity.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Monitoring/Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"o: Two large-bore IVs to be placed preoperatively, ultrasound-guided if necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Consider arterial line placement if bleeding risk increases or hemodynamic instability develops.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Avoid carboprost (Hemabate) due to asthma.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"o: No contraindication to oxytocin, methylergonovine (pending BP), misoprostol, or tranexamic acid.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Close monitoring in PACU.,,,,,,,,,,,,
o: Potential ICU admission if general anesthesia is used or in the event of significant hemorrhage.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"o: If intubated intraoperatively, patient may remain sedated until extubation is deemed safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,
All concerns and questions were addressed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pain management preferences and medication history were reviewed with the patient and will be communicated to the care team on the day of delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
