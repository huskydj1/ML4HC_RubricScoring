[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]: Hello. Good morning. This is Dr. Smith from the Brigham and Women's Hospital OB anesthesia team.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:06.520 --> 00:13.780]: I'm looking for Ms. Jane Blink. Yes, this is she. Good morning. Good morning. Your OB team asked",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
[00:13.780 --> 00:19.700]: our team to reach out with you to talk about some anesthesia related considerations given some of,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:19.700 --> 00:25.160]: your history in this current pregnancy. Do you have about 15 minutes to speak with us? Yeah,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:25.160 --> 00:32.880]: they mentioned that someone from anesthesia will call me. Okay, perfect. We've reviewed your chart",,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:32.880 --> 00:37.880]: and we'd just like to discuss some of the findings from your most recent imaging in the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:37.880 --> 00:44.540]: pregnancy, if that's okay? Yeah. Great. I know from the ultrasound you have some findings that",,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
"[00:44.540 --> 00:49.900]: are concerning for placenta accreta spectrum, is that right? Yeah, my doctor said that. Okay,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:49.900 --> 00:51.700]: what did they tell you about that?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:53.160 --> 00:54.680]: They said that,,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:54.680 --> 01:06.060]: the placenta may be implanted in the wrong place and very deep and because of that I may be,,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:06.060 --> 01:12.480]: bleeding or they may have to do a hysterectomy. They may have to remove the uterus and I won't,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[01:12.480 --> 01:19.340]: be able to have more children. Yes, those are always a possibility with placenta accreta",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
[01:19.340 --> 01:24.440]: because the placenta is attached in an abnormal way to the uterus.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:24.680 --> 01:28.400]: We're here to just talk about some other things that we kind of consider,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[01:28.400 --> 01:33.320]: in these cases. Mm-hm. Now, based on the ultrasound I see",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[01:33.320 --> 01:39.260]: that the baby's also fairly large? Yeah. Okay, but the fluid around the baby looks normal so no polyhydramnios.",,,,Negative,,,,,,,,
"[01:39.260 --> 01:41.100]: Now, based on the ultrasound I see that the baby's also fairly large? Yeah. Okay, but the fluid around the baby looks normal so no",,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:41.100 --> 01:49.780]: polyhydramnios. I do see that you have two pretty big fibroids as well. I had a lot of,,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
[01:49.780 --> 02:00.140]: of ultrasounds before getting pregnant and those were always big. Got it. Otherwise I see no,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:00.140 --> 02:07.240]: preeclampsia so far in that pregnancy, is that right? No. Are you taking any blood thinner? I just take a baby aspirin",,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
"[02:07.240 --> 02:14.460]: every day in the morning. Okay, very good. And I also see some more recent labs in this pregnancy. I see",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:14.460 --> 02:20.460]: that your hemoglobin and hematocrit values are 9 and 27, which are a bit on the lower side.",,,Negative,,,,,,,Positive,,
"[02:21.380 --> 02:28.260]: Yeah, my blood counts have been always on the lower side but now during pregnancy my",,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:28.260 --> 02:39.320]: doctor was concerned so I'm taking some iron with the vitamins most of the days.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:39.560 --> 02:44.240]: Perfect, that's great. Your platelet count, which helps with",,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
[02:44.240 --> 02:44.400]: guit binder.æ•°.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:44.460 --> 02:51.580]: is also a little on the low side. It's 140, but still on an okay range. I'm just gonna talk a",,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
"[02:51.580 --> 02:58.700]: little bit more about some of your gynecologic history, if that's okay. Yeah. Okay, so I see",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:58.700 --> 03:06.620]: that you have some history of several DNCs, is that right? Yeah, it was very hard to get pregnant.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[03:06.620 --> 03:17.020]: We tried everything, and it was hard. There were, I had three miscarriages. Okay, sorry to hear that.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[03:17.020 --> 03:22.700]: I'm glad to hear that you're now pregnant. Otherwise, you've had a few other procedures",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[03:22.700 --> 03:35.260]: on the uterus, is that right? Yeah, I had fibroids my whole life, and when I was younger, I had",,,,,,Positive,,,,,,
"[03:36.620 --> 03:47.180]: two procedures to remove fibroids, and then just recently, before I got pregnant, I had another",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[03:47.180 --> 03:54.860]: surgery where they actually had to do like a big incision on my belly. Okay, I see. Yeah, I see in",,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:54.860 --> 03:59.980]: your past surgical history here that you've had two hysteroscopic removals of the myonectomies,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[03:59.980 --> 04:05.260]: through the vagina and the uterus, and the other, they did the incision. Yeah, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:06.620 --> 04:12.300]: And I have had a couple of other surgeries in the abdomen, is that right? Yeah, I've had Crohn's",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:12.300 --> 04:18.540]: disease since I was a teenager. Okay, so you've had a couple of surgeries, at least for that,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:18.540 --> 04:24.460]: it sounds like. Yeah, and I take medication. Okay, you currently have an ostomy, is that right? Yeah. Okay,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:25.340 --> 04:32.380]: got any other surgeries in your abdomen or in your pelvis other than those? No, this is,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:33.420 --> 04:35.180]: this is the only problem. Okay,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:36.620 --> 04:42.300]: very good. Do you have any bleeding disorders that we know of? No. Any clotting disorder? No. Great.,,,,,,,,Negative,,,,
"[04:42.300 --> 04:47.820]: Have you ever had a blood transfusion for any reason? No. Okay, and this pregnancy",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:48.380 --> 04:54.220]: was conceived by IVF, is that right? Yeah, we had many cycles of IVF, and this one",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:54.940 --> 05:01.340]: finally worked. I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad too. Yes, we're going to ask a little more about",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
"[05:01.340 --> 05:06.060]: some of your baseline medical history as well, is that okay? Yeah. Do you have any",,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:06.620 --> 05:13.660]: heart problems? No. Do you have any lung problems? I have had asthma now for a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[05:14.780 --> 05:22.140]: It started a couple of years ago, but most of the times when I take the inhaler,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[05:23.660 --> 05:31.820]: it's under control. Okay, do you take a medication daily for that? It's mostly an inhaler,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:32.620 --> 05:36.300]: and I take it when I kind of feel tight. Okay. Maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[05:36.620 --> 05:43.260]: once a week or so, maybe once every other week. Okay. Have you ever been hospitalized for the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[05:43.260 --> 05:52.860]: asthma? No. No, okay. Otherwise, any high blood pressure? No. Great. How are you doing in terms",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[05:52.860 --> 05:59.180]: of activity levels at this point in pregnancy? I've been pretty good, no problems. Great. Are",,,,,,,,,,,,
[05:59.180 --> 06:06.220]: you allergic to anything? No. Great. Do you have any personal or family-related problems with anesthesia?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:06.620 --> 06:14.780]: No. Great. Any scoliosis in the back? No. Awesome. And any hardware or back surgeries,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:14.780 --> 06:20.060]: things like that? No. Great. All right, thank you for answering all those questions. I know that it's",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:20.060 --> 06:24.700]: a lot, but it's very helpful for us to have all the information so we can",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:24.700 --> 06:30.860]: take excellent care of you. Okay, so some of your history, especially this placenta",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:30.860 --> 06:36.620]: creative finding, as well as the many prior procedures in your uterus, do you put you on a",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
[06:36.620 --> 06:42.180]: a higher risk of bleeding during this c-section. Yeah. That's probably why we want to make a good,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:42.180 --> 06:47.280]: plan with you and make sure that you are on board before the actual day of surgery, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:48.380 --> 06:54.900]: So the plan will be for a cesarean section, is that right? Yeah, and the doctor said that",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:54.900 --> 07:02.000]: they may have to remove my uterus, which I really hope doesn't happen because this is our first",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:02.000 --> 07:09.300]: child and we were hoping for one more. Sure, totally understand that. Our hope is that this",,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:09.300 --> 07:14.400]: all goes as smoothly as possible. We're going to help make sure we can do everything we can to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:14.400 --> 07:23.700]: keep you safe, okay? I know this is your first c-section. Yeah. Typically, the anesthesia for",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:23.700 --> 07:29.400]: these surgeries is what's called norexial, which means epidural or spinal. This means you'll get",,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:29.400 --> 07:31.880]: an injection that keeps you numb from...,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:32.000 --> 07:37.240]: Your mid-chest and downward, so that you're able to have surgery while still being awake and kind",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:37.240 --> 07:44.780]: of seeing when baby is born and things like that, okay? Yeah, I've never had that. Is that going to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:44.780 --> 07:53.040]: control my pain? Because with the Crohn's disease, it's been a lot of stomach pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:53.400 --> 08:00.500]: I'm sure that it has. Yeah, so the spinal or epidural are both really great in terms of",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:00.940 --> 08:01.900]: what pain control...,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:02.000 --> 08:05.740]: Yeah, pain control both during the surgery to make sure that you're comfortable, but we also give",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:05.740 --> 08:12.600]: medications that stay in your system for the first 24 hours that help with some of the baseline,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:12.600 --> 08:19.700]: initial pain that you'll have during the first day coming out of surgery, okay? We'll also get",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:19.700 --> 08:25.540]: other oral and IV medications for pain control as needed all throughout the post-op period, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:27.120 --> 08:30.940]: Now, for someone who's c-section might be less straightforward because",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:30.940 --> 08:36.940]: of your many prior surgeries in your abdomen as well as in your uterus and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:36.940 --> 08:42.080]: because of the placenta is a little bit abnormally attached, it may take longer",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:42.080 --> 08:49.800]: than normal, so we might opt for a longer acting option for your anesthesia. That",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:49.800 --> 08:54.920]: usually means either combined spinal epidural or a long spinal. What that might,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:54.920 --> 08:59.320]: mean is that you might get an injection to get you numb into the spinal space, but",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:59.320 --> 08:59.920]: we might also thread in an epidural.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:59.920 --> 09:00.420]: That's a great idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:00.420 --> 09:00.920]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:00.940 --> 09:06.100]: catheter so that we can give you more doses of numbing medication in case the,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:06.100 --> 09:13.120]: surgery goes long yeah I'm really worried about pain because after my,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:13.120 --> 09:19.120]: crown surgery I had a lot of pain and I had to take one medication and it was,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:19.120 --> 09:24.640]: making me very nauseous they gave me another medication and it was just so,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:24.640 --> 09:30.940]: painful the recovery was long well we will absolutely make sure that during,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:30.940 --> 09:34.880]: the surgery that you are not having any pain that's one of our number one,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:34.880 --> 09:41.080]: priorities and then we can also adjust the dosing of some of our medications,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.400]: for post-op pain so that you get higher than usual doses so it'll make sure that,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:45.400 --> 09:51.760]: it's well controlled enough for you yeah thank you I usually take a lot to to get,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:51.760 --> 09:54.400]: me comfortable I don't know why,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:54.400 --> 09:54.600]: but I'm sure it's going to be okay for you,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:54.600 --> 09:54.620]: but I'm sure it's going to be okay for you,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:54.620 --> 10:00.380]: with the Crohn's disease it was a lot okay that can we can often see that on,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:00.380 --> 10:03.940]: patients who have Crohn's disease and have had many procedures in the past,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:03.940 --> 10:11.220]: okay now in terms of some of the other things we will always do at least one IV,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:11.220 --> 10:15.620]: for anyone who's delivering or having a c-section in your case because you're at,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:15.620 --> 10:19.860]: a higher risk of bleeding will likely place two IVs that way we have good,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:19.860 --> 10:24.580]: access to give you fluids and medications okay we may need to use a,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:24.580 --> 10:31.840]: ultrasound to find some bigger veins in your arms if needed we can give some,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:31.840 --> 10:36.680]: numbing medication to the skin before using those bigger IVs okay okay I never,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:36.680 --> 10:42.820]: had problems with IV that's good to hear now sometimes you also place a special,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:42.820 --> 10:47.740]: IV called an arterial line basically instead of going into the vein it goes,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:47.740 --> 10:54.540]: into the artery to help monitor your blood pressure on a basis rather than waiting for the blood pressure to be in the vein,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:54.540 --> 11:01.040]: cuff to cycle we only do that if you're having kind of more significant bleeding,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:01.040 --> 11:05.420]: and we need a tighter control of your blood pressure yeah they mentioned that,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:05.420 --> 11:13.620]: before when I was having the fibroid surgery but it was okay okay good to know,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:13.620 --> 11:18.340]: now we'll be communicating closely with your OP team about blood loss all,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:18.340 --> 11:22.780]: throughout the surgery okay if you have significant blood loss we might give you,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:22.780 --> 11:23.580]: a variety of medications to help you broken out of the vein and to improve your,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:23.580 --> 11:29.620]: medications to help your uterus thicken tract, or to help prevent the breakdown of clotting factors in the blood.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:30.480 --> 11:37.000]: Based on your history, there's one that we will probably avoid called Hemabate. It can exacerbate asthma for people.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:37.140 --> 11:41.300]: Okay. But the other ones should all be safe for you to use. Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:42.040 --> 11:46.340]: Now if you have significant blood loss, we might need to do a blood transfusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:46.340 --> 11:52.080]: Mm-hmm. Only if necessary, are you okay receiving a blood transfusion? Yeah, I understand. Very good.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:52.080 --> 12:00.860]: Now if bleeding is very significant, or if your OB decides to proceed with the removal of the uterus, or something more invasive,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:01.480 --> 12:08.020]: we might adjust our anesthetic plan. Okay. Even if the spinal or epidural anesthesia is working,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:08.080 --> 12:15.120]: we may need to convert to general anesthesia, where you're completely asleep with a breathing tube for your safety,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:15.400 --> 12:17.400]: depending on how things look. Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:18.200 --> 12:21.360]: Now we'll communicate that with you before any of that happens.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:22.080 --> 12:24.880]: But we'll give IV medications that would make you fall asleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:25.300 --> 12:31.580]: And once you're asleep, we place a breathing tube to have good control over your airway and breathing. Okay. Okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:33.020 --> 12:40.820]: Now if that does happen, and you have a breathing tube, our goal is always for it to be a temporary measure during the surgery itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:41.700 --> 12:47.720]: However, if you require more interventions or more transfusions before becoming medically stable,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:48.600 --> 12:50.600]: we sometimes send you to an ICU,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12:50.600 --> 12:54.460]: for a closer monitoring until we can fully wake you up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:55.580 --> 12:57.980]: If that happens, we'll give you a sedating medication",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12:58.820 --> 13:02.260]: up until the point that the breathing tube comes out, okay? Okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:03.120 --> 13:05.480]: And I know that's a lot, that's a very uncommon event,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:07.140 --> 13:11.520]: but we want to kind of talk about all the possibilities and let you know that we're planning for everything to keep you safe, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:11.520 --> 13:13.520]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13:14.320 --> 13:17.980]: I know it's a lot of information, it can be very, very overwhelming.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:17.980 --> 13:25.260]: um what questions do you have about any of that um i'm just worried about pain because my doctor,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:25.260 --> 13:33.480]: said that um the she would do everything to preserve my uterus and it may be a really long,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:33.480 --> 13:43.160]: procedure so like what can i have for pain during the procedure or afterward yeah um both sure so,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:43.160 --> 13:49.200]: you should not have pain during the surgery itself um the medications in the epidural and,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:49.200 --> 13:53.660]: spinal kind of take away the sensation of sharpness or pinching or anything like that,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13:53.660 --> 14:00.440]: during the surgery okay you may feel touch and pressure at times but you shouldn't have any like,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:00.440 --> 14:05.660]: discomfort okay we're there with you the entire time to help ensure that you're comfortable enough,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:05.660 --> 14:12.960]: that's our number one priority okay okay um now um like we said if the case,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:12.960 --> 14:13.140]: you're in a situation where you're in a situation where you're in a situation where you're in a,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:13.140 --> 14:18.460]: runs longer we can always dose up the epidural with more medication to keep you numb if at any,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:18.460 --> 14:23.660]: point you're in too much pain or discomfort or it's not working anymore we can always have the,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:23.660 --> 14:30.000]: back option of going to sleep with general anesthesia okay okay as we mentioned um we'll,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.780]: give medications into the epidural and spinal that will be in your system for the post-op period of,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:34.780 --> 14:41.100]: time okay initially but you'll also have some scheduled oral options um and if needed we might,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:41.100 --> 14:42.940]: give some iv medications,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:42.940 --> 14:48.700]: uh and might use what's called a pca pump um to help with pain control afterward if you need it,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:48.700 --> 14:57.280]: okay okay what other questions do you have um no other questions my biggest concern was my pain but,,,,,,,,,,,,
[14:57.280 --> 15:05.700]: thank you for explaining of course um right so before you hang up we will briefly have you speak,,,,,,,,,,,,
