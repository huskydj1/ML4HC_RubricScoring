00:00.920 --> 00:01.440,Hello.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:02.340 --> 00:07.640,Good morning. This is Dr. Smith from the Brigham and Women's Hospital OB-Anesthesia Team.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07.960 --> 00:09.820,I am looking for Ms. Jane Blank.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10.240 --> 00:10.800,This is Shay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:11.480 --> 00:18.820,Hi there. Your OB asked our anesthesia team to reach out to you to talk about some anesthesia-related considerations.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:19.480 --> 00:22.100,Do you have 10 to 15 minutes to speak with us?,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:22.240 --> 00:23.100,"Yes, I do.",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:23.440 --> 00:24.720,Great. Thank you for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:24.720 --> 00:31.820,Great. We've reviewed your chart. We'd just like to discuss some of the recent findings in the current pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:32.260 --> 00:32.500,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:32.940 --> 00:39.440,"I know you had a recent ultrasound, which shows you have a placenta previa. Is that correct?",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
00:40.300 --> 00:43.500,Did your OBs talk a little bit more about what that means for delivery?,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:44.760 --> 00:49.780,Yes. She mentioned that the placenta is basically in front of the baby.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49.780 --> 00:54.640,So she recommended scheduled C-section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:54.720 --> 00:58.300,And that's going to be our plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:58.300 --> 01:02.500,Yes. That is the standard that we do in these kind of situations.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:02.500 --> 01:07.700,"So we just want to talk to you a little bit more about what you expect surrounding that, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:07.700 --> 01:08.200,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:08.200 --> 01:18.900,"Otherwise, in this pregnancy, I see the imaging shows there's the previa, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence of placenta accreta, which is a good thing.",Positive,Negative,,,,,,,,,,
01:18.900 --> 01:19.400,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:19.400 --> 01:23.660,I also see that you have a pretty big baby. Is that right?,,,,,Positive,,,,,,,
01:23.660 --> 01:24.160,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:24.160 --> 01:24.660,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:24.720 --> 01:26.720,"Also, lots of fluid around the baby.",,,,Positive,,,,,,,,
01:26.720 --> 01:27.220,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:27.220 --> 01:32.720,"Great. Otherwise, it seems like everything's been going pretty well in this pregnancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:32.720 --> 01:33.220,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:33.220 --> 01:35.220,No preeclampsia. Is that right?,,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
01:35.220 --> 01:35.720,No.,,,,,,,Negative,,,,,
01:35.720 --> 01:37.720,Any high blood pressures in the pregnancy?,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:37.720 --> 01:38.220,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:38.220 --> 01:41.720,Great. And are you taking any anticoagulation?,,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
01:41.720 --> 01:46.720,No. I just take prenatal vitamins. No other medicines.,,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
01:46.720 --> 01:54.720,"Perfect. I know they drew some labs during your last visit, and it looks like your blood counts, they can tell.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:54.720 --> 01:55.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:55.720 --> 01:56.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:56.720 --> 01:57.720,So you're taking the globin and hematocrit. They look great.,,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
01:57.720 --> 01:58.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
01:58.720 --> 02:00.720,12.5 and 37. They're awesome numbers.,,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
02:00.720 --> 02:01.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:01.720 --> 02:12.720,I was going to talk a little bit more about some of your other OB and GYN history. You had a couple of DNEs. Is that correct?,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:12.720 --> 02:16.720,Yeah. We've been trying to get pregnant.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:16.720 --> 02:21.720,"Okay. Just those two prior procedures, is that correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:21.720 --> 02:22.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:22.720 --> 02:23.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:23.720 --> 02:25.720,Have you had any procedures on your uterus before?,,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
02:25.720 --> 02:26.720,No.,,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
02:26.720 --> 02:28.720,No fibroid removal or anything like that?,,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
02:28.720 --> 02:29.720,No.,,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
02:29.720 --> 02:33.720,Great. Have you ever had any other surgeries in your abdomen or your pelvis?,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:33.720 --> 02:35.720,No. That's the only problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:35.720 --> 02:38.720,Okay. Any bleeding or clotting disorders?,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:38.720 --> 02:39.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:39.720 --> 02:41.720,Have you ever had a blood transfusion for any reason?,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:41.720 --> 02:42.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:42.720 --> 02:46.720,Great. And this is pregnancy IVF?,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:46.720 --> 02:47.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:47.720 --> 02:48.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:48.720 --> 02:50.720,That finally worked for us.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:50.720 --> 02:52.720,I'm so happy that it did.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:53.720 --> 02:57.720,We're going to talk a little bit more about sort of just like your baseline medical history.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:57.720 --> 02:58.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:58.720 --> 02:59.720,Do you have any heart problems?,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:59.720 --> 03:00.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:00.720 --> 03:01.720,Any lung problems?,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:01.720 --> 03:02.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:02.720 --> 03:05.720,Great. I know you just mentioned no high blood pressures.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:05.720 --> 03:06.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:06.720 --> 03:08.720,Great. Do you have any allergies to medication?,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:08.720 --> 03:09.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:09.720 --> 03:12.720,Any personal problems with anesthesia in the past?,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:12.720 --> 03:14.720,"No, not really.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:14.720 --> 03:17.720,Any anesthesia-related problems in your family?,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:17.720 --> 03:18.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:18.720 --> 03:22.720,Great. Any scoliosis that you're aware of?,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:22.720 --> 03:23.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:23.720 --> 03:27.720,Great. And any prior procedures on your back? Any hardware in your back?,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:27.720 --> 03:28.720,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:28.720 --> 03:35.720,Great. All of that tracks is what we see in your chart here. Thank you for answering all,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:35.720 --> 03:39.720,those questions. That helps us get all the information we need to help take really good,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:39.720 --> 03:40.720,"care of you, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:40.720 --> 03:41.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:41.720 --> 03:48.720,"So some of the history that you have, just like having the placenta previa, having a",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:48.720 --> 03:50.720,couple of prior D&Es.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:50.720 --> 03:51.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:51.720 --> 03:55.720,Those kind of slightly increase your risk of bleeding compared to the normal C-section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:55.720 --> 03:56.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:56.720 --> 04:00.720,So we just want to talk a little bit more about things surrounding that. I know this,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:00.720 --> 04:02.720,is going to be your first C-section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:02.720 --> 04:03.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:03.720 --> 04:08.720,"So most commonly, we do these procedures under what's called neuraxial anesthesia, which",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:08.720 --> 04:09.720,means spinal or epidural.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:09.720 --> 04:10.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:10.720 --> 04:15.720,"Okay? Typically, for our first time C-section, we'll do what's called a spinal injection.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:15.720 --> 04:20.720,That basically is like a single shot that gets you numb from about the mid-chest down.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:20.720 --> 04:21.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:21.720 --> 04:22.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:22.720 --> 04:25.720,That just gives you a good amount of numbness for the surgery itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:25.720 --> 04:26.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:26.720 --> 04:27.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:27.720 --> 04:32.720,"The anesthesia team from that day will talk to you a little bit more about that, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:32.720 --> 04:33.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:33.720 --> 04:40.720,"Now, because you're slightly higher risk of bleeding, we might just place an extra",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:40.720 --> 04:41.720,IV in you as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:41.720 --> 04:42.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:42.720 --> 04:43.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:43.720 --> 04:44.720,Every patient gets an IV for a C-section or a delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:44.720 --> 04:45.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:45.720 --> 04:46.720,But we might do an extra one just so we have good access.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:46.720 --> 04:47.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:47.720 --> 04:48.720,In case we need to give you more fluid.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:48.720 --> 04:49.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:49.720 --> 04:50.720,"Or perhaps if this ends up needing to happen, a blood transfusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:50.720 --> 04:51.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:51.720 --> 04:52.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:52.720 --> 04:53.720,We can always use an ultrasound to try to find the bigger veins that are deeper in,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:53.720 --> 04:54.720,your arm where there's nothing visible.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:54.720 --> 04:55.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:55.720 --> 04:56.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:56.720 --> 04:57.720,"Now, we'll be in close communication with the OB team.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:57.720 --> 04:58.720,We're there with you the whole time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:58.720 --> 04:59.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:59.720 --> 05:14.720,If they start running into any significant bleeding and we have any concerns about your,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:14.720 --> 05:17.720,"blood pressure, we can always place a special IV.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:17.720 --> 05:18.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:18.720 --> 05:19.720,We can always place a special IV called an arterial line.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:19.720 --> 05:20.720,That will help us monitor your blood pressure on a beat-to-beat basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:20.720 --> 05:21.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:21.720 --> 05:22.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:22.720 --> 05:23.720,We'll often use an ultrasound and some numbing medication if we need to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:23.720 --> 05:24.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:24.720 --> 05:25.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:25.720 --> 05:26.720,"Now, we'll be talking with the OBs the whole time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:26.720 --> 05:27.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:27.720 --> 05:28.720,"If they do run into higher than usual bleeding, we might need to do a blood transfusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:28.720 --> 05:29.720,"I don't think it's super, super likely, but always a possibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:29.720 --> 05:30.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:30.720 --> 05:31.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:31.720 --> 05:32.720,Are you okay receiving blood?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:32.720 --> 05:33.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:33.720 --> 05:34.720,Are you okay receiving blood?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:34.720 --> 05:35.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:35.720 --> 05:36.720,Are you okay receiving blood?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:36.720 --> 05:37.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:37.720 --> 05:38.720,Are you okay receiving blood?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:38.720 --> 05:39.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:39.720 --> 05:40.720,Are you okay receiving blood?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:40.720 --> 05:41.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:41.720 --> 05:42.720,Are you okay receiving blood?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:42.720 --> 05:43.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:43.720 --> 05:44.720,If needed?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:44.720 --> 05:45.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:45.720 --> 05:46.720,Great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:46.720 --> 05:47.720,There's also some other medications we can give to help your uterus contract a little,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:47.720 --> 05:48.720,bit after a baby comes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:48.720 --> 05:49.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:49.720 --> 05:50.720,"Based on your history, I don't see any reason why you couldn't get any of those.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:50.720 --> 05:51.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:51.720 --> 05:52.720,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:52.720 --> 05:53.720,"So, we'll be there to administer those for you as well if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:53.720 --> 05:54.720,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:54.720 --> 06:09.720,"Now, like I said, the spinal is going to be the primary plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:09.720 --> 06:11.420,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:11.420 --> 06:13.300,You're going to need that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:13.300 --> 06:13.720,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:13.720 --> 06:19.960,"Um, if in the off chance that, you know, things go extra long or we need to kind of escalate",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:19.960 --> 06:25.280,"things or you're getting uncomfortable, um, we can always convert to general anesthesia",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:25.280 --> 06:25.860,if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:26.120 --> 06:27.540,That's where you go completely to sleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:28.000 --> 06:28.460,Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:28.460 --> 06:32.480,"Um, we get IV medication and we place a breathing tube just to keep you nice and safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:32.700 --> 06:32.960,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:33.460 --> 06:33.740,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:33.800 --> 06:36.640,"Um, we always have that kind of in our back pocket as an option.",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:37.160 --> 06:37.560,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:37.760 --> 06:38.020,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:38.760 --> 06:40.660,"Um, I know that was a lot of information.",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:41.020 --> 06:42.680,Do you have any questions about any of that?,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:44.180 --> 06:45.760,"No, I think I'm all set.",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:46.020 --> 06:46.940,"Okay, great.",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:47.080 --> 06:51.060,"Um, before you go, we'll have you briefly talk to Dr. Jones, who's one of our attending",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:51.060 --> 06:52.440,anesthesiologists here.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:52.720 --> 06:52.960,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:54.880 --> 06:55.560,All right.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:56.160 --> 06:57.500,"Hi there, Ms. Blake.",,,,,,,,,,,,
06:58.340 --> 06:58.740,Hi.,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:58.900 --> 07:00.260,"Hi, this is Dr. Jones.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:00.360 --> 07:03.560,I'm one of the OB anesthesiologists here at the Brigham and Women's.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:03.620 --> 07:04.440,Nice to meet you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:04.540 --> 07:06.080,It's nice to meet you as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:06.400 --> 07:11.480,"Um, I read your chart and I was listening along to your conversation with Dr. Smith.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:12.220 --> 07:13.700,"Uh, it sounds like he mentioned some of our care.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:13.720 --> 07:16.200,"Yeah, he mentioned some of our considerations for patients who have higher, uh, bleeding",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:16.200 --> 07:16.800,risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:17.240 --> 07:17.400,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:17.400 --> 07:21.160,"I just want to make sure you don't have any more questions, uh, about anything before",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:21.160 --> 07:21.720,we hang up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:22.080 --> 07:24.840,"No, he did a great job, uh, explaining everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:25.360 --> 07:25.660,Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:25.740 --> 07:26.840,I'm so glad to hear that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:27.360 --> 07:31.740,"Um, we'll document everything that we discussed in the chart, uh, note in your chart.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:32.380 --> 07:36.600,"Um, in the meantime, if you think of any questions, you can always reach out through the OB team.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:37.300 --> 07:39.380,"Um, have a good rest of your day.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:39.720 --> 07:42.260,"Thank you so much for, uh, talking to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,
07:42.260 --> 07:43.080,Of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:43.220 --> 07:43.560,Bye-bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:43.720 --> 07:44.120,Bye-bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
