High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 41,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G6P3023,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 31w0d,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pregnancy: Singleton,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placenta previa with concern for placenta accreta spectrum and increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage in the setting of multiple prior cesarean deliveries.,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ms. Jane Blank is a 41-year-old G6P3023 at 31 weeks gestation with a singleton pregnancy referred for high-risk anesthesia consultation due to findings of placenta previa with suspected placental implantation into a prior cesarean scar.,Positive,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
"Ultrasound imaging demonstrates anterior placenta previa with myometrial thinning and possible scar involvement, raising concern for placenta accreta.",Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
"The fetus is noted to be large for gestational age, and polyhydramnios is also present.",,,,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,
"She has had three prior cesarean sections, with her most recent delivery complicated by postpartum hemorrhage (estimated blood loss of approximately 1.1L), requiring administration of tranexamic acid and carboprost.",,,,,,,,,,,,
She has no prior history of accreta or abnormal placentation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Labs show hemoglobin of 11 g/dL, hematocrit 33%, and platelets 200K.",,,,,,,,,,Positive,Positive,
She has had no bleeding episodes in the current pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Cesarean Deliveries: Three prior; all low transverse incisions; no prior vaginal deliveries.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	PPH History: One episode during most recent C-section requiring uterotonics (TXA and carboprost); no transfusions to date.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	History of Preeclampsia: Reported during first and second pregnancies; managed in subsequent pregnancies with aspirin, currently normotensive.",,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
•	Other Uterine Procedures: Two dilation and curettage procedures for early pregnancy loss.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Other Surgeries: None reported on the uterus, abdomen, or pelvis.",,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
•	Placenta Accreta History: None prior to this pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Bleeding/Clotting Disorders: None.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Transfusion History: None.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Fertility Treatments: No IVF.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Medical History: Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine); otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, cardiac, pulmonary, or clotting disorders.",,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
"•	Surgical History: No history of back surgeries, scoliosis, or spinal instrumentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Anesthesia History: Epidural for first C-section, spinal anesthesia for subsequent scheduled C-sections; no reported complications.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Allergies: None.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Family History of Anesthesia Complications: None reported.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Functional Status: Ambulates independently, remains active caring for three children at home; denies dyspnea, chest pain, or syncope.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Physical Exam: Deferred (telehealth visit).,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 41-year-old G6P3023 at 31w0d with three prior cesarean deliveries, current anterior placenta previa with suspected accreta spectrum, polyhydramnios, and a large-for-gestational-age fetus. She is at elevated risk for postpartum hemorrhage due to multiple contributing factors: placenta previa with possible accreta, history of postpartum hemorrhage, prior uterine instrumentation (C-sections and D&Cs), and uterine overdistension from polyhydramnios and fetal size.",Positive,Positive,,Positive,,,,,,,,
Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Scheduled cesarean delivery with potential for peripartum hysterectomy if placenta accreta is confirmed intraoperatively.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Proceed with neuraxial anesthesia: combined spinal-epidural (CSE) or long-acting spinal technique.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Conversion to general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation may be required if bleeding is severe or operative duration is prolonged.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	CSE preferred to allow prolonged surgical anesthesia and flexibility for re-dosing if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	General anesthesia to be initiated intraoperatively only if clinically necessary for maternal safety.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring / Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Two large-bore IVs to be placed preoperatively; ultrasound guidance as needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Consider arterial line placement (e.g., radial) for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring if significant hemorrhage or hemodynamic instability arises.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"•	Plan for standard use of uterotonics (oxytocin, misoprostol, carboprost, tranexamic acid) as clinically indicated.",,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Methylergonovine to be used cautiously due to history of preeclampsia; alternate agents preferred initially.,,,,,,,Positive,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Potential for postoperative ICU admission if bleeding is severe or patient remains unstable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	Possible need for continued intubation and sedation postoperatively if general anesthesia is required and patient cannot be safely extubated in the OR.,,,,,,,,,,,,
All discussed with patient.,,,,,,,,,,,,
She expresses understanding and agrees to blood transfusion and hysterectomy if clinically indicated.,,,,,,,,,,,,
All questions were addressed during the call.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation shared with obstetric and anesthesia teams for coordinated care.,,,,,,,,,,,,
