[00:00.000 --> 00:07.400]: Hello. Good morning. This is Dr. Smith from the Brigham and Women's Hospital OB anesthesia team.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:07.400 --> 00:14.640]: I'm looking for Miss Jane Blank. This is she. Great. Your obstetrician asked our team to reach,,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:14.640 --> 00:20.460]: out to you to chat about some anesthesia related considerations given some of your history. Do you,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:20.460 --> 00:26.520]: have 10 to 15 minutes to speak with us? Yeah, now is a good time actually. Okay, perfect. We've",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:26.520 --> 00:31.860]: reviewed your chart. We'd just like to discuss some of your history and our plans, if that's",,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:31.860 --> 00:39.060]: okay? Sure. Great. We looked at the imaging from the current pregnancy. It looks like you have,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:39.060 --> 00:46.340]: something called placenta previa. Is that correct? Yeah, and also my doctor mentioned that my placenta",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:46.340 --> 00:55.700]: is in the wrong place. My doctor said that it's kind of like in the front and it's,,,,,,,,,,,,
[00:55.700 --> 00:56.500]: maybe in the middle.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[00:56.520 --> 01:04.780]: In the scar of the previous C-section. Yes, that's what we see here on the ultrasound as well. It looks",,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:04.780 --> 01:10.900]: like there's some previa and then there's some implantation in the prior scar and it's a little,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
[01:10.900 --> 01:17.920]: bit thin in that area. Yeah. Yeah. Those findings just put you at higher risk for something that's,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[01:17.920 --> 01:25.440]: called placenta accreta. Yeah. They mentioned that to you. Yeah, she mentioned. Okay. Got it. That's",,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
[01:25.440 --> 01:26.360]: probably why we're calling.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[01:26.740 --> 01:31.980]: Just to discuss some of those risks. Otherwise, based on the ultrasound, it also looks like baby",,,,,Positive,,,,,,,
[01:31.980 --> 01:38.160]: is pretty big. Is that right? Yeah. All my children have been on the large side. Got it.,,,Negative,,Positive,,,,,,,
"[01:38.580 --> 01:43.420]: It looks like there's lots of fluid around the baby as well. Yeah. Got it. Otherwise, it looks",,,,Positive,,,,,,,,
"[01:43.420 --> 01:49.400]: like no fibroids. Is that right? Yes, no fibroids. Great. Do you have any preeclampsia in this",,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
"[01:49.400 --> 01:56.500]: pregnancy? No, not this time. I had in my previous, my first pregnancy, and I had a preeclampsia in my",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[01:56.520 --> 02:04.020]: second pregnancy. And since then, I've been taking aspirin every time and it's been, my blood",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:04.020 --> 02:10.900]: pressures have been good. I check them very regularly. Perfect. Otherwise, just based on the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:10.900 --> 02:16.000]: labs, looks like your hemoglobin and hematocrit were 11 and 33 most recently, which is within",,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
"[02:16.000 --> 02:21.800]: normal limits. As well as your platelet count was 200, which is great. Yeah. My doctor hasn't",,,,,,,,,,,Positive,
[02:21.800 --> 02:24.880]: mentioned anything about that. Okay. Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:26.520 --> 02:33.160]: Can I ask a little bit more about those prior deliveries, if that's okay? Yeah. Great. So it",,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:33.160 --> 02:39.760]: looks like you've had three C-sections before. Is that right? Yeah. The first one was a C-section,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:39.760 --> 02:46.460]: and then yes, every, every, every, all other deliveries have been C-sections. Got it. No",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:46.460 --> 02:52.380]: vaginal deliveries, correct? No. Sounds like the first one, you had an epidural and then you ended",,,,,,,,,,,,
[02:52.380 --> 02:55.320]: up going for a C-section. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[02:56.520 --> 03:02.200]: Since then, for your anesthesia, have you had spinal injections? Yeah. Got it. Yeah. And it was so much",,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:02.200 --> 03:12.400]: better. Everything was scheduled and yeah. Yes. People typically prefer the scheduled C-sections,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[03:12.400 --> 03:19.200]: are often a bit smoother and more comfortable. Yeah. The first one, it was a really long ordeal.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[03:19.200 --> 03:26.240]: I had fever. I was so tired. I almost don't remember much. Okay. That's,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:26.240 --> 03:26.500]: that's obvious. Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:26.520 --> 03:31.360]: That's often how it goes. But it sounds like this one will be scheduled as well. Yeah. It should be,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:31.360 --> 03:41.360]: more pleasant. Have you had any DNCs in the past? Yeah. We had problems. It was hard to get,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[03:41.360 --> 03:50.720]: pregnant the first time. So I had, we tried many times and then I had two miscarriages. Okay. I see",,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:50.720 --> 03:56.340]: nothing since then? No. Okay. And any hysteroscopies or any other,,,,,,,,,,,,
[03:56.520 --> 04:03.000]: surgeries on the uterus? No. Great. Any surgeries in your abdomen or your pelvis otherwise? No. Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:03.000 --> 04:11.340]: Now, it sounds like based on the charting that you have a history of bleeding during your most recent",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:11.340 --> 04:18.200]: C-section when you also had a previa. Is that correct? Yeah. The, the blood loss was a little",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:18.200 --> 04:25.980]: bit higher at that time. Yes. It looks like you lost about 1.1 liters, which is on the higher side.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[04:26.520 --> 04:37.280]: It looks like they gave a couple of medications called TXA and Carboprost to help with the bleeding. Yeah. Okay. No other bleeding during your prior,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:37.280 --> 04:55.640]: sections though, is that right? No. I mean, there was some bleeding, but it was normal. Okay. Perfect. And in the past, you haven't had a history of the placenta accreta risk that we talked about? No. Okay. This is the first time I heard about this. Got it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[04:56.520 --> 05:26.180]: As far as you're aware, have all of your prior sections been a normal low transverse incision in your belly? Have they ever said anything about a classical incision? Yeah. I believe everything was okay. Okay. Very good. Any history of any bleeding or clotting disorders? No. Got it. Have you ever had a blood transfusion? No. No. Any IVF for this current pregnancy? No. We were about to try with the first one. Okay. But I got pregnant.", ,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
"[05:26.520 --> 05:56.500]: Got it. Great. Are we going to ask a little bit more about some of your other baseline history, if that's okay? Yeah. I've been mostly healthy. Okay. Very good. Any heart problems? No. Any lung problems? No. Any high blood pressures in this pregnancy? No. I just had preeclampsia with my first pregnancy, but after that, I've been taking the aspirin, and I've been checking my blood pressures every day, and it has",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
"[05:56.520 --> 06:26.000]: always been normal. Fantastic. That's great. Any asthma history? No. Great. How have you been doing activity level-wise at this point in the pregnancy? I still go to work. I mean, I get tired. I have three little ones at home. Of course. I'm sure you have your hands full. Yes. It's been okay. Okay. Very good. Are you allergic to anything? No. Great. Do you have any personal or any family-related", ,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:26.520 --> 06:56.500]: history of anesthesia problems? No. I haven't heard of any problems. Great. Any scoliosis in your back? No. Any back surgeries before? No. Great. All right. Thank you for giving us all that information. It's really important for us to have all of this so that we can take really excellent care of you and make the best possible plan. Some of your history, including the prior C-sections, the bleeding in the most recent one, as well as", ,,,,,,,,,,,
"[06:56.500 --> 07:26.480]: the placenta previa and the possible accreta, those all put you at a higher than normal risk of bleeding. That's why we're talking with you right now. And because of that, we wanted to make a good plan before your C-section. Make sure you know what to expect from our side. As you know from your prior cesarean sections, we typically do these surgeries under either a spinal or epidural anesthesia. So often when you've had multiple prior C-sections, or when we're concerned that you're", ,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
"[07:26.500 --> 07:30.880]: at a higher risk of bleeding, or that surgery might take longer than usual, we",,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
[07:30.880 --> 07:37.520]: do a longer-acting option. Okay? Most likely we'll do either what's called a,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:37.520 --> 07:42.220]: combined spinal epidural, or use a longer-acting spinal injection for this",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:42.220 --> 07:48.900]: surgery. Yeah, my doctor said that the C-section may be long. She mentioned",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:48.900 --> 07:55.700]: that they may have to take the uterus if I really have accreta. And to be honest,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[07:55.700 --> 07:56.480]: I'm okay with that. There's a lot of backâ€”,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[07:56.480 --> 08:00.080]: okay, this is, I don't want to have any more children,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:00.320 --> 08:02.940]: but I want to make sure this one is born healthy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:03.840 --> 08:09.520]: So I understand that this may be a very long surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:10.220 --> 08:10.500]: Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:12.220 --> 08:14.920]: That's always a possibility in this kind of scenario,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:15.220 --> 08:17.240]: but we'll talk you kind of through the things,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:17.240 --> 08:19.680]: that might happen to expect, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:19.960 --> 08:20.240]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:21.620 --> 08:24.160]: So we will do either that combined spinal epidural,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:24.460 --> 08:26.280]: which is basically a spinal injection,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:26.480 --> 08:30.000]: plus a little catheter so that we can dose you more medication,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.320]: to keep you numb or for longer if we needed to.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:32.500 --> 08:32.820]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:33.140 --> 08:34.740]: Or we'll do a long-acting spinal.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:35.440 --> 08:38.100]: The team that they have will discuss that further,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:38.100 --> 08:39.700]: with your obstetrician, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:39.840 --> 08:41.940]: Yeah, do whatever you need to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:42.060 --> 08:42.420]: Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:44.140 --> 08:46.140]: Now, some other things that we consider.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:46.580 --> 08:47.900]: Given your risk of bleeding,",,,,,,,,,Negative,,,
[08:48.480 --> 08:51.560]: we will likely place two IVs for you,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[08:51.560 --> 08:53.720]: before we get things started, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:53.820 --> 08:55.540]: That way we make sure you have good access,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:55.540 --> 08:56.460]: to give you fluids.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:56.540 --> 08:57.320]: We'll also make sure you have good access,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:57.320 --> 08:58.100]: to blood products if necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:58.720 --> 08:59.100]: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.460]: We might use an ultrasound to help find some bigger veins,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:03.460 --> 09:08.820]: to have a more reliable access if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:09.140 --> 09:09.400]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:09.560 --> 09:09.840]: Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:10.800 --> 09:13.420]: Now, we'll be communicating closely with your OB team",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:13.420 --> 09:15.180]: about blood loss during the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:15.660 --> 09:17.140]: If it becomes very significant,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:17.380 --> 09:18.680]: we might give you some medications,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:18.680 --> 09:20.860]: to help your uterus to contract,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:20.860 --> 09:23.740]: or to help prevent the breakdown of clotting factors,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:23.740 --> 09:24.400]: in your blood.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:24.880 --> 09:25.300]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:25.820 --> 09:26.180]: Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:26.480 --> 09:28.680]: I know you received some of these last time,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:28.680 --> 09:29.580]: when you had the bleed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:29.820 --> 09:30.060]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:31.520 --> 09:32.460]: Based on your history,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:32.560 --> 09:34.300]: most of these are very safe to use for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:34.640 --> 09:37.340]: There's one that we tend to avoid called methogen,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:37.340 --> 09:39.380]: in patients who have a history of preeclampsia,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:39.380 --> 09:40.260]: or high blood pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:41.480 --> 09:43.140]: So we'll probably use some of the other ones,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:43.140 --> 09:44.560]: before we would use that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:44.660 --> 09:44.880]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:45.000 --> 09:45.380]: Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:46.720 --> 09:51.120]: Now, so there's always a risk of needing a blood transfusion",,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:51.120 --> 09:52.940]: if blood bleeding is very significant.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:53.520 --> 09:53.780]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:53.780 --> 09:55.920]: Are you okay receiving a blood transfusion,,,,,,,,,,,,
[09:55.920 --> 09:56.420]: if necessary?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:56.420 --> 09:58.240]: Yeah, my doctor mentioned",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[09:58.240 --> 10:02.100]: that if we have to do a hysterectomy,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:02.560 --> 10:05.440]: most likely I will have a blood transfusion.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:05.980 --> 10:06.840]: And yes, I'm okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:07.220 --> 10:07.440]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:07.620 --> 10:08.040]: Very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:08.100 --> 10:08.540]: Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:10.240 --> 10:12.100]: Now, if blood bleeding is very significant,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:12.620 --> 10:15.760]: we might also do some extra monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:15.760 --> 10:18.720]: with a special monitor called an arterial line.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:19.360 --> 10:20.740]: That's basically like an IV,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:20.960 --> 10:23.080]: but it goes in the artery instead of the vein,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:23.800 --> 10:25.320]: usually in your wrist.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:25.540 --> 10:25.580]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:25.580 --> 10:25.620]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:25.620 --> 10:25.680]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:25.680 --> 10:25.740]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:25.740 --> 10:25.760]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:25.760 --> 10:25.780]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:25.780 --> 10:26.040]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.040 --> 10:26.060]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.060 --> 10:26.120]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.120 --> 10:26.140]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.140 --> 10:26.160]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.160 --> 10:26.180]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.180 --> 10:26.200]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.420 --> 10:26.460]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.460 --> 10:26.480]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.480 --> 10:26.520]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.520 --> 10:26.560]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.560 --> 10:26.580]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.580 --> 10:26.600]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.600 --> 10:26.640]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.640 --> 10:26.660]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.660 --> 10:26.680]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.680 --> 10:26.700]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.700 --> 10:26.720]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.720 --> 10:26.760]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.760 --> 10:26.780]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:26.780 --> 10:26.800]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:29.800 --> 10:30.900]: Does it hurt?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:31.580 --> 10:33.600]: It feels basically similar to an IV.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:33.880 --> 10:35.880]: We can give some numbing medication to the skin,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:35.880 --> 10:36.760]: to help with that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:37.020 --> 10:37.360]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:37.460 --> 10:37.760]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:38.320 --> 10:40.740]: We do that instead of cycling the blood pressure cuff,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:40.740 --> 10:42.640]: every couple of minutes so that we're able to have,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:42.640 --> 10:44.900]: a better idea of what your blood pressure is doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:45.340 --> 10:45.600]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:45.760 --> 10:45.980]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:47.440 --> 10:50.500]: Now, if the bleeding is very significant",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:50.500 --> 10:53.460]: or if your OB decides to proceed with a hysterectomy,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:54.060 --> 10:56.300]: we might adjust our anesthesia plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:56.420 --> 10:56.820]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[10:56.960 --> 11:00.340]: If that happens, even if the spinal or epidural is working,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:00.520 --> 11:02.740]: we might need to convert to general anesthesia,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:02.740 --> 11:04.600]: with a breathing tube for your safety.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:05.080 --> 11:05.320]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:05.460 --> 11:05.820]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:07.780 --> 11:10.780]: We give the medication to the IV that makes you fall asleep,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:10.780 --> 11:13.040]: and then we place the breathing tube after you're sleeping.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:13.180 --> 11:13.420]: Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:13.640 --> 11:13.880]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:14.440 --> 11:14.840]: All right.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:15.380 --> 11:16.980]: We just do that to keep you safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:17.860 --> 11:18.160]: Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:18.580 --> 11:21.340]: If that happens, our goal is always for that to only be",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:21.340 --> 11:25.140]: during the actual surgery itself and to wake you up at the end.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:25.140 --> 11:29.820]: However, if you're needing more interventions or more transfusions",,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:29.820 --> 11:31.600]: before becoming medically stable,",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:32.220 --> 11:36.760]: sometimes we need to send you to a monitored unit like an ICU,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:36.760 --> 11:39.560]: and before we can fully wake you up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:39.780 --> 11:40.060]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:40.600 --> 11:44.200]: If that's the case, we will keep giving you sedating medications",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:44.200 --> 11:46.460]: to keep you asleep while that breathing tube is in.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:46.760 --> 11:47.080]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:47.220 --> 11:49.220]: And that would be removed while you're in the ICU.,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:49.580 --> 11:49.840]: Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:50.500 --> 11:50.820]: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[11:51.500 --> 11:52.840]: Now, I know that was a lot of information.",,,,,,,,,,,,
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.040]: It's very overwhelming.,,,,,,,,,,,,
