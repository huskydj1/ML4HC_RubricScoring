00:24.120 --> 00:26.720,Do you have 10 to 15 minutes to speak with us?,,,,,,,,,,,,

00:32.140 --> 00:36.420,"We'd just like to discuss some of the findings from your recent pregnancy, if that's okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36.720 --> 00:37.200,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:38.200 --> 00:45.040,"I know you had a recent ultrasound done, which shows some placenta previa as well as some",Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
00:45.040 --> 00:46.700,concern for placenta accreta.,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
00:46.840 --> 00:47.480,Is that right?,,,,,,,,,,,,

00:50.600 --> 00:51.120,Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:52.020 --> 00:57.260,Did your obstetrician talk about kind of what that might mean for your delivery?,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:58.420 --> 00:59.260,She said that...,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:00.000 --> 01:07.180,"I will probably need a C-section, and this may be quite of a big surgery in my case.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:07.680 --> 01:09.160,"Yes, that is correct.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:09.240 --> 01:10.520,That's always a possibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:10.900 --> 01:14.960,"It's part of why we wanted to talk to you, to kind of give you an idea of what to expect, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:15.080 --> 01:17.180,"Yeah, she said that I need to talk to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:17.460 --> 01:17.800,Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:19.540 --> 01:23.740,"So, based on the imaging here, I also see that baby is pretty big.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:23.760 --> 01:24.340,Is that right?,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:24.340 --> 01:27.960,"Yeah, this one is way bigger than my previous one.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:28.220 --> 01:29.980,"And already, I'm just 30.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:30.120 --> 01:30.700,Two weeks.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:31.180 --> 01:31.420,Right.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:31.900 --> 01:34.480,And the ultrasound also showed bigger baby.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:34.640 --> 01:37.600,"So, I guess this one will be larger.",,,,,,,,,,,,
01:37.780 --> 01:38.280,Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:38.380 --> 01:38.700,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:39.840 --> 01:44.400,"But otherwise, the imaging here looks pretty good.",,,,Negative,,,,,,,,

01:57.140 --> 01:59.980,My obstetrician started me on a...,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
02:00.120 --> 02:04.240,a baby aspirin in the beginning of the...,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
02:04.360 --> 02:07.700,It's pretty much as soon as I learned that I was pregnant.,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
02:07.820 --> 02:08.320,Okay.,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
02:08.960 --> 02:09.460,Got it.,,,,,,,,,Positive,,,
02:10.600 --> 02:14.080,I see they drew some labs around this last visit as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:14.200 --> 02:17.940,Looks like your hemoglobin hematocrit numbers look good.,,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
02:17.940 --> 02:21.320,"They're 12 and 36, which, from our perspective, is a good place to be.",,,,,,,,,,Positive,,
02:21.680 --> 02:22.340,"Uh-huh, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,

02:24.220 --> 02:24.720,Great.,,,,,,,,,,,,

02:29.660 --> 02:30.160,Uh-huh.,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:30.360 --> 02:33.360,"Um, can you tell me about those?",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:34.060 --> 02:39.260,"Yeah, um, we have tried a while for, uh, for kids.",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:39.260 --> 02:46.220,"And, um, the first time, my first pregnancy was a spontaneous loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:47.040 --> 02:49.660,"Um, I think it was just pretty early.",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:49.820 --> 02:54.240,"There was some bleeding, but, um, I didn't need to do anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:54.960 --> 02:59.260,"Uh, and then my second pregnancy, um, I had...",,,,,,,,,,,,
02:59.660 --> 03:00.480,I had vaginal delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:01.080 --> 03:02.080,Everything was okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:02.460 --> 03:03.640,I was sent home.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:04.440 --> 03:12.260,"Um, and then all of a sudden, maybe after a week or so, um, there was so much blood,",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:12.440 --> 03:14.160,and I felt a little dizzy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:14.580 --> 03:21.000,"So, um, when I called my obstetrician, uh, she said to come to the hospital,",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:21.400 --> 03:24.180,"and then everything happened, like, pretty quick.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:24.780 --> 03:28.460,"Um, they needed to take me to the operating room.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:28.460 --> 03:34.820,"Um, they had to do, like, a procedure, because there were some parts of the placenta, I think,",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:34.900 --> 03:37.180,"that were still, uh, there.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:37.580 --> 03:44.220,"Um, they were, um, um, there was a lot of blood everywhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:45.060 --> 03:49.120,"Um, but after that, I, I was okay, mostly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:49.920 --> 03:56.920,"Um, and so we kept trying to have more children, and, um, I think I had two miscarriages.",,,,,,,,,,,,
03:57.800 --> 03:57.920,And...,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:58.580 --> 04:06.220,"And, uh, both times, I needed, um, to go to the operating room, um, because there, there were some products,",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:06.320 --> 04:09.820,"and I was also very worried, uh, about bleeding.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:10.600 --> 04:11.200,Um...,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:11.200 --> 04:13.140,Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:13.220 --> 04:16.140,I see you've had a pretty tough time here.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:16.240 --> 04:16.420,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:16.680 --> 04:16.960,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,

04:20.200 --> 04:20.540,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:20.540 --> 04:28.180,"Um, for your, uh, delivery, um, did you have an epidural surrounding that?",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:28.460 --> 04:29.840,Or some other form of pain control?,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:30.700 --> 04:31.300,"Uh, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:31.520 --> 04:34.640,"I had an epidural, and it worked great the whole time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:34.640 --> 04:41.860,"Like, I felt no pain, um, just a little pressure, pushed for, you know, 45 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:42.100 --> 04:43.320,Baby came right out.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:43.380 --> 04:44.940,I was so happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:45.360 --> 04:45.640,Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:45.780 --> 04:47.120,"I'm, I'm glad to hear that.",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:47.580 --> 04:55.560,"When you had those, uh, those other procedures, the DNC, were you kind of, like, asleep, kind of sedation, sleepy situation?",,,,,,,,,,,,
04:55.860 --> 04:56.840,I think so.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:57.160 --> 04:57.500,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:57.500 --> 04:57.940,Um...,,,,,,,,,,,,

05:01.700 --> 05:04.940,"Uh, but I don't remember a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:05.240 --> 05:07.840,No issues with the anesthesia for any of those?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:08.160 --> 05:08.440,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:08.640 --> 05:14.160,"One time I got nauseous, but I think that I needed some, um, medications.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:14.680 --> 05:18.120,"And after they gave me something, it was okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:18.300 --> 05:19.380,So it wasn't too bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:19.700 --> 05:20.060,Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,

05:42.460 --> 05:43.460,Is that right?,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:43.460 --> 05:44.460,No.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:44.460 --> 05:45.460,Um...,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:45.460 --> 05:51.840,I was really surprised that bleeding happened after so many days after I had delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:51.840 --> 05:52.840,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:52.840 --> 05:55.840,"It's always possible, uh, to have a lot of delay there.",,,,,,,,,,,,
05:55.840 --> 05:56.840,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:56.840 --> 05:57.840,I'm glad that you came in and they took care of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,

09:09.260 --> 09:09.480,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:10.120 --> 09:12.780,we opt for like a longer acting spinal.,,,,,,,,,,,,

09:25.080 --> 09:25.280,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:25.420 --> 09:25.760,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:26.380 --> 09:26.620,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:27.600 --> 09:32.940,"Now, both of those are very safe and very similar in terms of the actual procedure itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:34.540 --> 09:40.700,The actual plan will be kind of decided by the team the day of when they talk to your OB.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:41.100 --> 09:41.440,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:41.580 --> 09:41.800,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:41.800 --> 09:41.860,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:43.220 --> 09:43.780,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:43.780 --> 09:44.900,"So they're very, very safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:45.940 --> 09:46.260,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:46.520 --> 09:46.920,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:48.020 --> 09:54.420,"Now, because you have a slightly higher bleeding risk, we will likely do two IVs for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
09:54.500 --> 09:54.740,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:54.740 --> 09:59.780,"Just to make sure we have good access, we can give you fluids or any blood products if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:00.260 --> 10:00.620,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:00.900 --> 10:01.160,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:01.260 --> 10:07.820,My obstetrician mentioned that this surgery may be a little more involved than a typical C-section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:08.240 --> 10:08.600,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:08.600 --> 10:13.740,And she also said that I will likely need a blood transfusion.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:13.780 --> 10:18.680,"So, she said that I definitely need to come to this hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:19.220 --> 10:19.580,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:19.680 --> 10:23.840,I'm glad you're coming here so that we can have everything nice and set up for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:24.000 --> 10:25.560,"Hopefully, you don't need these things.",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:25.740 --> 10:26.040,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:26.200 --> 10:28.700,But we like to take all the precautions that we can.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:28.900 --> 10:29.100,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:29.100 --> 10:29.520,Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:29.720 --> 10:30.100,Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:30.140 --> 10:30.440,Of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:31.460 --> 10:33.300,"But yeah, we'll place those IVs.",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:33.340 --> 10:38.300,"We might use an ultrasound to help find some deeper veins in your arm, depending on how",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:38.300 --> 10:39.360,visible your veins are.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:39.520 --> 10:39.800,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:39.880 --> 10:40.180,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:41.180 --> 10:43.740,"Now, we'll be there the whole time and communicating with you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:43.740 --> 10:43.760,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:43.780 --> 10:48.340,"If they run into an OB team, if they run into a situation where there's more bleeding and",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:48.340 --> 10:53.760,"we kind of need a closer monitor of your blood pressure, we might place what's called an arterial",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:53.760 --> 10:55.860,"line, very similar to an IV.",,,,,,,,,,,,
10:56.160 --> 11:00.700,"It just kind of goes in the wrist, and that helps monitor your blood pressure on a beat-to-beat",,,,,,,,,,,,
11:00.700 --> 11:01.200,basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:01.440 --> 11:01.560,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:02.540 --> 11:05.620,We can also use an ultrasound for that and give some numbing for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:05.820 --> 11:06.060,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:06.140 --> 11:06.400,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:09.100 --> 11:12.960,"Now, as we said, we'll be closely communicating with the OBs.",,,,,,,,,,,,
11:12.960 --> 11:13.300,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:13.300 --> 11:16.360,"If they're having lots of bleeding, we might give you a blood transfusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,
11:16.720 --> 11:18.380,You're okay receiving that only if needed?,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:18.940 --> 11:19.620,"Yeah, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,
11:19.740 --> 11:20.020,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:20.340 --> 11:25.860,My obstetrician mentioned that we may have to have the blood ready before the C-section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:26.360 --> 11:29.360,"Yes, I think that's a good idea in this kind of scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,,
11:29.680 --> 11:29.980,Uh-huh.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:31.080 --> 11:33.160,"So that, again, we're prepared for anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,
11:33.260 --> 11:35.360,It can move kind of nice and quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:35.780 --> 11:36.040,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:37.300 --> 11:42.800,"Now, we'll also be kind of administering other medications to help your uterus contract if",,,,,,,,,,,,
11:42.800 --> 11:43.260,there's any issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:43.380 --> 11:43.400,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:43.400 --> 11:43.840,With that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:44.160 --> 11:44.400,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:44.520 --> 11:44.740,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:44.880 --> 11:48.940,"Based on your history, you know, the only one we might avoid would be what's called",,,,,,,,,,,,
11:48.940 --> 11:50.360,carboprost or hemobate.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:50.900 --> 11:52.840,We tend to avoid it in people who have asthma.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:53.520 --> 11:53.620,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:53.620 --> 11:53.760,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:53.760 --> 11:57.800,But there's several others that we can also give to help your uterus contract.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:58.060 --> 11:58.300,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:58.440 --> 11:58.800,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:01.800 --> 12:09.340,"Now, if bleeding is very significant or OB team decides they need to escalate things",,,,,,,,,,,,
12:09.340 --> 12:09.780,more.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:10.100 --> 12:10.400,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:11.420 --> 12:13.240,To help stop the bleeding in your uterus.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:13.360 --> 12:18.120,"Or if they decide they need to work on removing the uterus, which is kind of the ultimate",,,,,,,,,,,,
12:18.120 --> 12:19.080,backup option.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:19.180 --> 12:19.460,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:19.600 --> 12:21.540,We might need to adjust our anesthesia plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:21.620 --> 12:21.840,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:22.100 --> 12:22.360,Yep.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:23.060 --> 12:27.640,"So even if the spinal or the epidural are working, if that happens, we might need to",,,,,,,,,,,,
12:27.640 --> 12:29.500,convert to what's called general anesthesia.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:29.660 --> 12:29.940,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:30.040 --> 12:31.480,That's where you're completely asleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:31.860 --> 12:32.100,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:32.660 --> 12:37.200,We typically place a breathing tube in that situation just to help give good control over,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:37.200 --> 12:38.720,your airway and breathe for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:38.960 --> 12:39.220,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:39.280 --> 12:39.560,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:40.080 --> 12:40.400,Yep.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:40.400 --> 12:40.800,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:40.800 --> 12:43.220,"We would only do that, like, after 20.",,,,,,,,,,,,
12:43.340 --> 12:43.740,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:43.860 --> 12:44.700,There's no surprises.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:45.020 --> 12:45.280,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:45.360 --> 12:46.720,We communicate everything with you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:47.140 --> 12:47.640,Got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:47.920 --> 12:48.300,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:49.100 --> 12:49.380,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:49.420 --> 12:54.800,"Now, if you do need a breathing tube, our goal is always for it to be a temporary measure",,,,,,,,,,,,
12:54.800 --> 12:55.840,just during the surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:56.340 --> 13:00.400,"But if you're having ongoing bleeding and we're needing to give you more fluids, more",,,,,,,,,,,,
13:00.400 --> 13:04.720,"medications, things like that, we might just keep you asleep with that breathing tube in",,,,,,,,,,,,
13:04.720 --> 13:06.480,while we stabilize everything nicely.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:07.040 --> 13:10.780,"Send you to a more monitored unit, like an ICU, before waking you up.",,,,,,,,,,,,
13:11.200 --> 13:11.420,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:11.520 --> 13:11.720,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:12.100 --> 13:12.680,I understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:12.680 --> 13:17.660,"I don't anticipate that, but, you know, always that possibility that you might wake up in",,,,,,,,,,,,
13:17.660 --> 13:19.720,a different location than where you fall asleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:19.940 --> 13:20.160,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:20.240 --> 13:20.560,Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:21.440 --> 13:21.900,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:22.640 --> 13:24.100,I know this was a lot of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:24.920 --> 13:26.920,What questions do you have for us?,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:28.000 --> 13:29.420,I think I'm good.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:29.560 --> 13:33.180,I understand that there is a high risk for bleeding.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:33.900 --> 13:38.440,I was pretty close with the last couple of times.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:38.620 --> 13:42.620,So this is not very surprising.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:42.620 --> 13:42.660,Mm-hmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:42.660 --> 13:45.960,But thank you so much for explaining everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:46.380 --> 13:47.320,"You're very, very welcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,
13:47.600 --> 13:49.480,And we're always here to answer your questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:50.000 --> 13:54.540,We'll certainly talk to you the day of the surgery itself to go over everything again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:56.960 --> 14:00.240,But you can also always reach out to us through your OB team.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:01.660 --> 14:06.660,"Before you hang up, we'll briefly have you speak with one of our attending anesthesiologists",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:06.660 --> 14:08.320,here at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:08.460 --> 14:08.880,Is that okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:09.280 --> 14:09.540,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:09.960 --> 14:10.260,Great.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:11.360 --> 14:12.200,"Hi, Ms. Blank.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:12.200 --> 14:12.300,"Hi, Ms. Blank.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:12.300 --> 14:12.500,"Hi, Ms. Blank.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:12.500 --> 14:13.820,This is Dr. Jones.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:14.400 --> 14:17.040,I'm one of the OB anesthesiologists here at the Brigham.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:17.520 --> 14:18.600,"Hello, Dr. Jones.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:18.680 --> 14:19.020,Hi.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:19.080 --> 14:20.120,It's nice to meet you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:21.040 --> 14:25.260,"I read your chart, and I was listening along to your conversation with Dr. Smith.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:25.740 --> 14:30.400,It sounds like he mentioned some of our considerations for patients who have a higher bleeding risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:30.660 --> 14:30.880,Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:31.200 --> 14:34.820,I just want to make sure you don't have any more questions about anything before we hang up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:35.160 --> 14:36.160,"No, I'm all set.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:36.480 --> 14:38.340,I think I understand well now.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:38.580 --> 14:38.980,Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:40.680 --> 14:41.900,I'm glad to hear that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:41.900 --> 14:46.080,"We'll document everything we discussed in this phone call, in your chart.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:48.300 --> 14:50.500,"Otherwise, that should be it for today.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:50.780 --> 14:52.600,"We'll keep you safe and comfortable, okay?",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:53.080 --> 14:53.360,Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:53.540 --> 14:54.380,Thank you so much.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:54.500 --> 14:55.340,"You're very, very welcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,
14:55.500 --> 14:56.040,Have a good one.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:56.280 --> 14:56.640,Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:56.820 --> 14:57.140,Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:57.300 --> 14:57.480,Bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,
