High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient Name: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRN: 000000015,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 34,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G5P1031,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 33w3d,,,,,,,,,,,,
Singleton Pregnancy,,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
Placenta previa with concern for placenta accreta spectrum; high risk of postpartum hemorrhage in setting of prior uterine procedures and prior delayed postpartum hemorrhage.,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,Positive,Positive,,,Positive,,,,Positive,Positive,,
"Jane Blank is a 34-year-old G5P1031 at 33w3d gestation with a singleton pregnancy, presenting for high-risk anesthesia evaluation due to concerning placental findings and history of obstetric complications. Recent imaging demonstrates placenta previa and sonographic features raising concern for placenta accreta. The fetus is noted to be large for gestational age, but there is no evidence of polyhydramnios. She has been started on low-dose aspirin this pregnancy. Her most recent hemoglobin and hematocrit were 12 g/dL and 36%, respectively.",Positive,Positive,,Negative,Positive,,,,Positive,Positive,,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
First pregnancy: Early spontaneous miscarriage managed expectantly without intervention.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second pregnancy: Term vaginal delivery with initially uncomplicated postpartum course; however, approximately one week postpartum, the patient developed heavy vaginal bleeding and dizziness. She was taken to the OR for a dilation and curettage (D&C) due to retained products of conception, with significant intraoperative bleeding, though no transfusion was required.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Third and fourth pregnancies: Miscarriages requiring D&Cs in the OR due to incomplete passage and bleeding.,,,,,,,,,,,,
No prior cesarean deliveries; this will be her first.,,,,,,,,,,,,
No known uterine anomalies or fibroids.,,,,,,Negative,,,,,,
No prior myomectomies or hysteroscopies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Medical History: Celiac disease (diet-controlled), hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine), well-controlled asthma (intermittent inhaler use), generalized anxiety disorder (on sertraline).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Surgical History: Three prior D&Cs; no other abdominal or pelvic surgeries.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allergies: Rash with ampicillin in the past; has tolerated other antibiotics since.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia History: No complications during epidural anesthesia for vaginal delivery or monitored anesthesia care for prior D&Cs; one instance of mild nausea managed effectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Family History: No known anesthesia-related complications.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social/Functional Status: Denies back pain or procedures; no scoliosis or spinal abnormalities.,,,,,,,,,,,,
IVF Pregnancy: Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 34-year-old G5P1031 at 33w3d gestation undergoing her first cesarean delivery, complicated by placenta previa and suspicion for placenta accreta. Her obstetric history is notable for one episode of delayed postpartum hemorrhage requiring surgical intervention, as well as multiple uterine instrumentation procedures (three D&Cs). These factors — placenta previa, concern for accreta spectrum, prior uterine procedures, and delayed postpartum hemorrhage — place her at significantly increased risk for hemorrhage during delivery.",Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scheduled cesarean delivery at tertiary care center with high-risk obstetric and anesthetic support,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Blood products to be typed, crossed, and readily available preoperatively",,,,,,,,,,,,
Preparedness for hysterectomy if placenta accreta is confirmed intraoperatively,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Neuraxial anesthesia preferred: likely combined spinal-epidural (CSE) for flexibility and prolonged surgical duration,,,,,,,,,,,,
Final modality (CSE vs. spinal) to be determined based on day-of clinical assessment and OB team plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Conversion to general anesthesia if indicated (e.g., hemodynamic instability, hysterectomy, or inadequate neuraxial block)",,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Neuraxial anesthesia is appropriate; patient had effective epidural analgesia in past,,,,,,,,,,,,
No contraindications noted to neuraxial placement,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Risks and benefits discussed, including conversion to general anesthesia and postoperative intubation if required",,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring/Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two large-bore peripheral IVs planned for case,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arterial line may be placed for continuous hemodynamic monitoring, especially if bleeding is significant or instability arises",,,,,,,,,,,,
Ultrasound guidance to be used as needed for vascular access,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oxytocin, misoprostol, and tranexamic acid available",,,,,,,,,,,,
Avoidance of carboprost (Hemabate) due to history of asthma,,,,,,,,,,,,
No contraindications to other uterotonics or antifibrinolytics,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If general anesthesia or hysterectomy is required, patient may require postoperative ICU care",,,,,,,,,,,,
Possibility of delayed extubation and continued sedation in ICU if clinically unstable,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anticipated close postoperative observation even if uncomplicated,,,,,,,,,,,,
All questions were addressed during the consultation. Patient is well informed of her elevated bleeding risk and potential for more intensive monitoring and interventions around the time of delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
