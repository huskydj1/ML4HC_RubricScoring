High-Risk Anesthesia Consult Note,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patient Name: Jane Blank,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRN: 000000001,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age: 35,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gravida/Para: G4P3003,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gestational Age: 33w3d,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiple Gestation: No – singleton pregnancy,,,Negative,,,,,,,,,
Chief Complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placenta previa and history of significant bleeding at prior cesarean delivery; high-risk obstetric anesthesia consultation for upcoming repeat cesarean section.,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
History of Present Illness,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jane Blank is a 35-year-old G4P3003 at 33w3d with a history of one prior vaginal delivery followed by two cesarean deliveries, the most recent of which was complicated by postpartum hemorrhage (estimated blood loss 1.7 L), requiring uterotonic medications but no transfusion. She is currently scheduled for a repeat cesarean section due to placenta previa, as identified on prenatal ultrasound. Imaging does not show evidence of placenta accreta spectrum. She also has a diagnosis of polyhydramnios and chronic hypertension, currently managed with labetalol and baby aspirin. She has not had episodes of vaginal bleeding in this pregnancy. Current hemoglobin is 10.5 g/dL, hematocrit is 32%, and platelet count is 165k.",Positive,Negative,,Positive,,,,,,Positive,Positive,
Past Obstetric History,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Pregnancy 1: Vaginal delivery with epidural; no complications.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Pregnancy 2: Cesarean section for breech presentation under spinal anesthesia; uncomplicated.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Pregnancy 3: Repeat cesarean section under spinal anesthesia complicated by postpartum hemorrhage (EBL 1.7L); managed with uterotonics, no transfusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• No history of uterine rupture, uterine inversion, or placenta accreta.",,Negative,,,,,,,,,,
"• No prior uterine surgeries (e.g., D&C, myomectomy).",,,,,,,,,,,,
• All cesarean deliveries were via low transverse incision.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other History / Baseline Anesthesia Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Medical History: Chronic hypertension, polyhydramnios. No preeclampsia or HELLP.",,,,Positive,,,Negative,Negative,,,,
"• Medications: Labetalol (intermittently), daily low-dose aspirin, prenatal vitamins.",,,,,,,,,,,,
• Allergies: None.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Surgical History: Cesarean sections only. No abdominal or pelvic surgery otherwise.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Anesthesia History: Tolerated neuraxial anesthesia (epidural and spinal) well in prior deliveries. No known personal or family history of anesthesia complications.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Functional Status: Active; walks regularly; no limitations with daily activities.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Respiratory/Cardiac: No known heart or lung disease. Reports mild pregnancy-related dyspnea without limitation in exertion.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Spine/Back History: No scoliosis, spinal surgery, or hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment and Plan,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a 35-year-old G4P3003 at 33w3d with placenta previa, polyhydramnios, chronic hypertension, and a history of significant hemorrhage during her most recent cesarean section. She is at increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage due to:",Positive,,,Positive,,,,,,,,
• Placenta previa,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
• Polyhydramnios,,,,Positive,,,,,,,,
• Prior cesarean section with significant blood loss (EBL 1.7 L),,,,,,,,,,,,
• Chronic hypertension,,,,,,,,,,,,
A multidisciplinary plan is indicated to mitigate hemorrhage risk and prepare for potential escalation of care.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plan:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obstetric Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Scheduled cesarean delivery for placenta previa.,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia Plan for Delivery:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Neuraxial anesthesia preferred (combined spinal-epidural or long-acting spinal), given prior tolerability and anticipated surgical duration.",,,,,,,,,,,,
• Backup plan includes conversion to general anesthesia if required due to hemodynamic instability or prolonged surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anesthesia/Analgesia:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Neuraxial technique will include intraoperative anesthesia and extended postoperative analgesia (e.g., intrathecal morphine).",,,,,,,,,,,,
• Postoperative pain management with scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDs; rescue opioids available PRN.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring/Access:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Plan for two large-bore peripheral IVs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Possible arterial line placement if bleeding risk escalates or if blood pressure monitoring requires more precision.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Ultrasound guidance and local anesthesia may be used for line placement as needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uterotonics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Will have uterotonics readily available (oxytocin, carboprost, misoprostol, tranexamic acid).",,,,,,,,,,,,
• Methylergonovine to be used cautiously or avoided due to maternal hypertension.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• No known contraindications to other agents.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postoperative Monitoring:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Routine postoperative recovery unless significant intraoperative hemorrhage or hemodynamic instability occurs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Possible ICU admission and delayed extubation if general anesthesia is required and patient remains unstable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
• Patient amenable to transfusion if indicated.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All risks, options, and potential complications were discussed with the patient. She was receptive to the plan and voiced understanding. No further questions were raised at this time. Final anesthesia decisions will be made on the day of surgery in coordination with the obstetric team.",,,,,,,,,,,,
